            <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>
              It's one of the most common refrains from successful NFL coaches; Thanksgiving is when the NFL season begins. By now, teams have a pretty good idea of who they are; what they do well and what they don't do well. For a big chunk of the league sitting there with two, three or four wins, with hopes of the post-season long in the rearview mirror, it's the realization that what they do well is insufficient to make up for their multitude of deficiencies and all the things they do poorly. For about 18 other teams, with six weeks left in the season, although most teams only have five games remaining, it's crunch time. 
              <br><br>
              The NFC West and the NFC South are the only divisions where we don't have a clear idea of who is going to represent them in the playoffs. In the South, it'll either be Atlanta (6-5) or Tampa Bay (5-6). Atlanta won the head-to-head series 2-0, which gives them an outsized advantage to winning the division, but their next two games are against the Chargers and the Vikings, where they will be underdogs, and another against the Commanders in Week 17, which could very easily be a loser leaves town match. In other words, no playoffs for the loser. If the Falcons can win one of those three, and win their three others playing scrap-heap teams waiting for the season to end, they'll end up at 10-7. That being the case, Tampa would essentially have to win out and finish at 11-6. With the exception of playing the Chargers in Week 15, their remaining schedule is cakewalk easy. Despite being a game behind and losing the first tie-breaker in deciding division champs, which essentially gives Atlanta a two-game advantage, I'd still favor the Bucs. I have no faith in the Falcons. They have no defence and a quarterback who throws a pretty ball, but can't move. The Bucs, on the other hand, have a good defence and an offence that continues to move the ball without Godwin and often without Evans. 
              <br><br>
              In the NFC West, we have four teams separated by one game in the standings. The Seahawks and Cardinals are 6-5. The Rams and 49ers are 5-6. The latter two are the sexy teams, but I can't see it happening for either of them. The 49ers have too many injuries, a diminished McCaffrey and a brutal schedule, starting in Buffalo this weekend. Many people are unprepared to call the 49ers dead until officially eliminated. I'm declaring them dead. The Rams are clinging to life-support. They forgot to show up against the Dolphins three weeks ago, and it hasn't gotten better since. If Stafford has time to throw with Cupp and Pacua on the outside, he'll carve up defences. Unfortunately, he never has time. Let's say they go 2-1 in games outside the division against the Saints, Bills and Jets, they'd still have to go 3-0 in their remaining games against each of the division foes and have a number of things fall their way. I don't see that happening. Which leaves us the Seahawks or the Cardinals. A couple of weeks ago, Seattle had the longest odds of any team in the NFC West. After wins against the 49ers and Cardinals, the Seahawks are in first place. The Seahawks will win with their defence. The Cardinals will win because of their offence. Given the choice, I'd favour the defence, although if Arizona wins in Minnesota this week, I could change my mind. I love Minnesota, but they are not a 9-2 team. They finished three games on the road 3-0, but they could have lost all of them. They'll make the playoffs as a wildcard themselves, and will have a huge stake in who else gets in the NFC, with games against Arizona, Atlanta, Seattle, and Green Bay. 
              <br><br>
              So, as a complete aside, I'm talking to the Disruptor last night. We're regaling in the Winnipeg Jets unlikely victory over the Minnesota Wild, which takes them to a league-leading 18-4 record for the year. For those of you not in the know, we're talking NHL hockey. Regardless, no small potatoes. Anyway, I also have my eye on the Chargers/Ravens game happening on the other channel. I say I like the Ravens decision to go for the two-point conversion after taking a seven-point lead in the fourth quarter. You get it, you're up two scores. You miss, you're still up seven. (They end up missing it, but remain up seven points) The Disruptor, by his very nature, has to take a different tact, saying he'd prefer to kick the extra-point to go up eight, forcing the Charger to get a touchdown and a two-point convert. I counter by saying it's still a one-score game. He says. "Not really. Because the two-point convert isn't a sure thing and I like to have points in the bag" and something or other about eight points not really being a one-score game. I could and should have said fair point, but I didn't. I said, "It's the fourth quarter. It's a good place to be in the fourth quarter", in a slightly heated manner. I could have, but didn't mention that Baltimore had scored on three consecutive drives and it looked like LA might only have two more possessions. Next thing I know, he's talking Marshawn Lynch and Seattle not giving him the ball a second time at the goal-line in their ill-fated Super Bowl agsinst the Patriots. I'm trying to draw a parallel between the two when he wants to go into a larger discussion of analytics and its flawed ways. For the record, I agree. Coaches are way ready to go for it in fourth-down in the first-half, and pass up an an easy three, but that's not the discussion I wanted to have. That's a much longer discussion to have in-person over beers rather than on the phone at 9 p.m. Anyway, rather than saying that, I hung up. Mid-sentence. No goodbye. No, I gotta go. Nada. It was very rude of me and I have since sent a conciliatory note to Eric explaining that I am a deeply flawed individual who lets his emotions get the better of him on occasion, especially when talking sports. So to make a long paragraph short, am I a prick and/or do you agree going for the two-point concert to go up nine in the fourth quarter is a good decision? I strongly maintain, yes, given what your team is and how they have been moving the ball. Anyway, let's leave the fourth-down decision to go for it on your own 18 in the first half to another time. The Disruptor may have a slightly different recollection of events. 
              <br><br>
              I know I'm the only guy that likes him, but Belichick on the Manning Cast of Monday Night Football is very entertaining and a great way to improve your knowledge of the game; offensive and defensive alignments, the different zone coverages. the backstory of "Omaha", which for a period of time, Peyton Manning appeared to be calling out on every play while in Denver. I don't get TSN+, but the segment, minus commercials, is available on Youtube every Monday. He's an absolute encyclopedia of all things football, and actually quite funny. I recognise this is a rehab job he's doing to improve his likeability and prove to everybody, including team owners, that he's not the mean, menacing person he's portrayed as. I'm kind of hoping he stays in the broadcast and podcast business. I can't imagine him anywhere else but Foxborough. 
              <br><br>
              A full heaping of football on Thursday with back-to-back-to-back games, with only the evening game of Miami @ Green Bay having playoff implications. There's another missable game on Friday as well.
