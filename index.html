        <h2>Welcome to the Wednesday Report</h2>
        <p>A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.  Admittedly, it doesnâ€™t 
        take much to get me excited about a new NFL season.
        Just the opportunity to spend hours aimlessly watching football every Sunday is enough to get me
        to buy in.  Every year brings changes and this one is no exception.  Aaron Rodgers is taking his
        first pro snaps for a team other than the Packers.  Lamar Jackson is finally playing for an offensive
        coordinator other than Greg Roman.  All three rookie quarterbacks who were picked in the first round
        are starting from Week 1.  We've got five months to figure out what's what. To get us started,
        as has been custom for at least four or five years, the opening weekend Wednesday Report team ranking,
        from worst to first.</p>
