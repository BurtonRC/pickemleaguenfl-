            <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL. No one remembers who lost the Super Bowl, just as no one recalls the second overall pick is of the annual draft. And then there's the more extreme version as Ricky Bobby's father puts it in one of the handful of truly ridiculous, albeit extremely funny, Will Ferrell movies, Talladega Nights, when he says, <strong>"if you're not first, you're last"</strong>. While there's weekly status reports and constant evaluation and reevaluation of Caleb Williams by virtue of his first pick celebrity status, the same attention hadn't beset the second overall pick, Jayden Daniels. And then last night happened. In his debut performance in front of an international audience, Daniels said "I've arrived". He was flawless, going 21-23 for 254 yard and three touchdowns in Washington's stunning 38-33 win over the winless Bengals. His pinpoint touchdown pass to McLaurin with under three minutes to go to put the Commanders up two scores was a thing of beauty.  I hadn't seen him play all year and was tuning in more to see if Cincinnati could get off the schneid. I mean, with the exception of Brad, who would forgo watching the Ravens playing the Bills to see the Commanders tangle with the Panthers, who had any expectation of Washington? As I said in my ranking at the beginning of the year, they had a new ownership, new coach and a new quarterback, but the one constant that would remain would be their losing. Well, they're 2-1 and the win last night wasn't fluky.  If Daniels brings more of what he delivered last night, Washington may have the franchise quarterback they've been seeking since the cut-short glory days of RGIII. I'm not sure I have them pegged to make the playoffs, but Daniels and the Commanders didn't wither under the bright lights. As a complete aside, Daryl and I will often talk music and reference bands that announced themselves with their first song, making it their calling card, playing brightly and boldly, without explicitly stating  "We've arrived". Kind of like Jayden Daniels last night. The most recent for me is Interpol's. Turn On The Bright Lights. Granted, we're going back many years, but bang, with the first notes of the first song, I'm in. Great album, There are many other examples. Give us yours.
              <br><br>
              Getting back to football, the Bengal's loss punched what could be an irreparable hole in the team’s preseason title hopes. Cincinnati entered 2024 with the sixth-best Super Bowl odds (73 percent). It slipped to 43 percent after last week's loss. They now face a historically steep climb to make the playoffs. Since 1990, only four teams have made the playoffs after an 0-3 start. While not quite as stark. six playoff teams from last year are 1-2; Ravens, Dolphins, Browns, Cowboys, 49ers, Rams. The forecast for some is not as bleak, as for others. The Dolphins and the Browns have to do serious re-appraisal. In Miami, Tua is gone for at least a couple more weeks, and their back-up, Skylar Thompson, hurt his back on Sunday and is doubtful for next week. Considering how poor he was in losing 23-3 to Seattle, that may not be a bad thing. I don't know who's next in line, but it can't be much worse. Stephen Ross and company should already be looking at next year. With the Browns, it comes back to the serial sexual predator, DeShaun Watson. He's been bad all year and last week he was particularly pathetic in losing to the hapless Giants at home. The Browns are paying him a king's ransom, but he's not getting better. If anything, he's regressing. Even if Stefanski wanted to bench him, he couldn't. Jimmy Haslan owns the team and he's the one who brought Watson to Cleveland and awarded him the completely unprecedented five-year contract of guaranteed money. Until he renages, Watson starts. Dawg pound be damned. He should really do a re-take. Just look at what the Red Rifle did for Carolina? Doesn't an intransigent owner owe it to its fans to give his team the best chance to win? Not in Jimmy Haslan's books. So we scratch off Cleveland and Miami. 
              <br><br>
              Next in line in the unenviable job of reviving diminishing playoff hopes would have to be the Rams. They pulled off a four-quarter miracle, but that was as much 49ers screw-ups as anything. Cupp is back on the injured list after two healthy weeks and Nacua is out of service for another 4-6 weeks. It's a scramble each week to get five linemen to protect Stafford, who's been great, but he can't overcome a growing number of injuries and a depleted defence. Dallas is a disaster as well. Dak will lead in the league in passing yards out of necessity. The defence that I thought would take a step-up with Mike Zimmer is in full retreat. The Ravens ran roughshod a week after the Saints put up 41 on the Cowboys in Jerry's World.  It's not much they have bad defensive players as they get pushed around; on defence and on offence. They can't run the ball and they can't defend the run; a terrible combination for a team with playoff aspirations. Between Mike McCartthy and Nick Sirianni, who put on another clinic on how not to coach, it's tough to say who Belichick will coach next. Despite the rash of injuries to big names in San Fran, I expect them to weather the storm. Baltimore could easily be 3-0. All the same, they play the current best team in the league on Sunday and could be 1-3. Josh Allen is a one-man wrecking crew. 
              <br><br>
              Of the two Patriot greats who got behind the mike this year, who would have thought Belichick would be better than Brady. Belichick is an encyclopedia of football knowledge and the informal structure of the various podcasts and the Manningcast he does, suit his style. Doing color commentary for football games, which Brady is doing for far more money than he ever made during his playing days, is often about dispensing short, pithy eight to ten seconds nuggets of insight and/or analysis. It's not standing at a podium post-game delivering gracious, well-mannered minute long post-mortems on a drive or a game. Like Belichick, Brady has a lot to say. Unfortunately, his medium doesn't afford him the time to say it. He'll get better, but he's no Greg Olsen or Tony Romo.  
              <br><br>
              So, am I the only one who noticed, or the only one who bothered to mention it, but how does the owner of a team induct himself into the team's Ring of Honour? Arthur Blank owns the Falcons. As far as the Atlanta Falcons are concerned, he can do anything he wants. But is it really necessary, or just a trite egotistical, to have a halftime ceremony inducting yourself into your team's Ring of Honour? Like someone on the induction committee is going to say no. You own the bloody team. I guess if you can't win a Super Bowl Ring, you have to ring your own bell. As per usual, the Chiefs won a game they could have easily lost. How that pass in the end zone in the final minute wasn't pass interference is beyond me. However, it's no time to be pounding the panic button in KC. Still, this is hardly the high-flying Chiefs of years past. It's a punchless passing game. Mahones needed 40 attempted passes to reach 220 yards against a bad Falcons defense.  His average depth of throw has decreased every year since 2018, when he took over as the Chiefs starter. No longer go balls and deep crosses to Tyreek Hill and Sammy Watkins. They're now manufacturing first downs with drag routes and quick-in patterns. They're a victim of the two-high coverage they forced defences to use against them. 
              <br><br>
              There's a lot more I could say, but it is unseasonably warm in the Peg. Mid-twenties and supposed to stay this way through the weekend so I'm cutting this short. 
              <br><br>
              Okay, time to enter the brave new world. The schedule, where you'll make your picks, is on the website. The standings are on the website. The Survivor series is coming and will be on the website soon. You can still make your pick Thursday and the rest Sunday. Nothing has really changed. An automated feature will send out people's picks out on a thread, similar to the thread we created with the Wednesday Report. 
              <br><br>
              A big thanks to Roudy, who did a lot of the heavy-lifting, We'll add to it as time goes along. There's a <strong>comment board</strong> on the <strong>This Week's Picks</strong> page so let's continue the banter. If you have any questions or issues with the site or your email confirmations, drop me a note. I think it's pretty self-explanatory.
