            <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL. Week 1 brought us everything we've come to expect from the opening of a new season; the buckled-down , do-your -job, highly efficient performances of Kansas City and Houston, to the mistake-laden, poorly-prepared outings from Cincinnati and Atlanta to the genuinely atrocious, comically-inept of the Carolina and the New York Football Giants. The first week of the season had it all. 
              <br><br>
              Which brings us  a new feature of Wednesday Report: the post <strong>Week 1 Panic Meter</strong>.
              <br><br>
              <strong>1. Cincinnati Bengals</strong> - They were horrible in every way, shape and form. In what has become the usual in all but one of the first five years of the Zach Talor-coached Bengals, the team lost its opening game. They were ill-prepared, sloppy and dismissive of the Patriots, who were 7.5 point dogs on the road with a rookie coach and a regurgitated, yet largely-functional quarterback. The Bengals are a shadow of their AFC Championship teams from a couple years back and Joe Burrow, despite his claims to the contrary, is not alright. He is either reluctant or unable to throw downfield, which during the Burrow years has been a defining feature of the Bengals offence . They're 0-1 and heading to Kansas City. In a conference where you may need 10 wins to make the playoffs. they'll have to go 10-5 the rest of the way. Yeah, I know. It's Week 1 and this may have been the first action some starters have seen since last year. You're over-reacting. That's not the way I see it. They're going to be 0-2, facing an uphill climb in one of the toughest divisions in football. <br><br>
              <strong>2. Green Bay Packers</strong> - This is not-so-much a reflection of their Week 1 performance, as the fact they'll be without Jordan Love for what could be the next 4-6 weeks. In his place, for at least next week, steps Malik Willis. Tennessee got rid of him in the off-season, when the Titans settled on Will Levins being their starter going forward. If you saw Will Levins against the Bears on Sunday, one can only imagine what the Packers will get from Willis. He was called into action to throw a Hail Mary in the final series against Philadelphia and didn't even get the pass off. Green Bay will have to find an alternative.  Tannehill, Ridder and Garoppolo. who were all starters at the beginning of last year, are all options and would be an upgrade over Willis. It's not inconceivable the Packers drop their next four and head to Houston 1-5. After the litany of starting quarterbacks who went down last year, the imperative of having a serviceable back-up QB still hasn't been heeded by  franchises, including the Packers.<br><br>
              <strong>3. Atlanta Falcons</strong> - For however bad Cousins was in his first start in Atlanta, more than an ample serving has to be given to the new coach and the new offensive coordinator. ESPN breaks it down statistically, but the Falcons play-calling and alignment was so coded, Pittsburgh knew what they were doing before the ball was snapped. TJ Watt lived in their backfield and said he was tipped off early in the game to the cadence of the count Cousins was using.  They couldn't see what was happening? They couldn't make adjustments? Cousins, head coach Raheem Morris and offensive coordinator Zac Robinson have each been around professional football a long time. That's completely inexcusable. For all the hype Atlanta has been given, and in particular, this offence, they generated just over 200 yards. They didn't want to give the head coaching job to Bill Belichick, fearing accountability may be expected. You get what you pay for. In this case, what you never want to be; a high-expectation, low delivery football team.<br><br> 
              <strong>4. Cleveland Browns</strong> - What do you do with DeShaun Watson? His on-field play is terrible, his off-field sexual assault allegations in Houston continue to come to light, and his fully-guaranteed $255 million contract is the benchmark of bad contracts, although I also said that of Russell Wilson's Denver contract. Denver eventually unloaded Wilson, but not before eating $80 million of dead money. Do you know what it would cost Cleveland to do the same? $172 million. It would be one thing if this was a blip, but he's been bad since he arrived in Cleveland, with no sign of him improving or ever regaining the magic he displayed in Houston. Joe Flacco came off the couch to save the Browns season last year.  Can Jameis Winston come off the bench to do it in 2024? He could get his chance sooner rather than later.<br><br> 
              <strong>5. Carolina / NY Giants</strong> - It's difficult to put either of these teams on the Panic Meter because so little is expected of them. It's hard to fathom how far these teams have fallen. Sam Darnold, playing on his fourth team in five years, looked like a star in craving up the Giants defence. Derek Carr, who's best before date expired five years ago, did his best Drew Brees impression in slicing up the Panthers. The Giants let Saquon Barkley join the Eagles because they didn't want to put up the additional $2 million a year it would take to keep him. He scored three touchdowns for the Eagles in his first game. The Giants started a number of no names to replace him who did squat. You don't let great players walk over $2 million per annum. The salary cap for NFL teams is more than $255 million a season. They can afford more than $40 million a year for a quarterback who can't play, but can't put up an additional two mill a year to keep one of the great running backs in the game. Carolina is a "don't go" zone. You know why Dave Canales is the head coach of Carolina? Because they couldn't find anyone else. Who wants to coach a dismal team with no upside in a small market with an owner who wants to run the organization, despite having no knowledge of the game? I can understand Canales taking the job because he wants to make a name for himself. The trouble is he'll come out of the Panther experience so maligned he'll never get a second chance to be a head coach.
              <br><br>
              There was a bunch of other note-worthy stuff. The rookie quarterbacks were average at best. The Arizona defence gave up 14 plays of 20 or more yards. Frankly, that's unbelievable. I must have heard that wrong. Doug Pederson pulled just enough buffon-like moves to cost the Jags the game in Miami. Tyree gets handcuffed. Dak gets paid. Rodgers didn't look half as bad as I thought he would. 
              <br><br>
              <strong>(The Unknown Football fact)</strong><br>
              The Sports Broadcasting Act (1961) prohibits the NFL from holding games from Friday after 5;00 p.m. from the second week of September to the second week of December in deference to High School Football. 
              <br><br>
              That's all I got time for. More than half of the league is out of the Survivor Series after Week 1, largely because Cincinnati decided to mail it in. I was going to say I'll try and do better next time, but I know I have appointments Monday morning and Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon, which will seriously cut into getting anything down. I promise you the three Ss: Standing, Schedule, Survivor.
