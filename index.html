              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>
              It's the end of Week 9. We've got a large enough sample size to know the good from the had, the contenders from the pretenders, the haves from the have nots, the wheat from the chaff, and/or any other binary you care to use. There aren't as many good teams in the NFC as there are in the AFC, but here, in no particular order, are the 14 teams I think will be playing post-season ball.

              <p>
                          
              It's hard to leave the Rams on the outside looking in because they have a good coach and a good quarterback and a number of other quality pieces on offence. But at 4-4, they are already two games behind Minnesota. The Viking schedule for the next six games is @ Jacksonville, @ Tennessee, Chicago, Arizona, Atlanta, @ Chicago. I can easily see them going 4-2, even 5-1, which gets them to 10 or 11 wins with five weeks to go, which should be more than enough, despite the Vikings endless propensity to make all things as difficult as humanly possible. Philadelphia, who I have pegged as one of the three wildcard teams from the NFC, is in itself a wildcard. I don't trust their coach or their quarterback. What they do have in their favour is playing the NFC East with the Cowboys and the Giants, Saquon Barkley, a steadily improving defence under Vic Fangio, and six wins in the bag. 
              <br><br>              
              As for the AFC, I think six of the seven teams have already booked their tickets. I can't even tell you why I think the 4-5 Bengals on their way to 4-6 after Sunday's tilt with Baltimore squeeze their way in, besides the fact I have faith in Joe Burrow. When he's healthy, he's great. I think Zach Taylor and a porous defence are the Brengal's two biggest liabilities. This is, of course, assuming all things are equal. And as we all know, all things are not equal. Someone is going to lose their quarterback for a few games or a wide receiver for the year changing the trajectory of their season. We don't know who it will be, but it will befall someone. As for the SuperBowl, at this point in time, barring unexpected injuries, suspensions or otherwise, there are only four teams that can win the Lombardi - Kansas City, Baltimore, Buffalo and Detroit. Even without Hutchison on defence, Detroit has proven again and again, they are better, stronger, nastier and can score more points in a game than any other team in the NFC. With the Lions steamrolling their way to home field advantage, no one comes into Detroit and beats the Lions. Only someone who's followed the NFL for the past thirty years can recognize the absurdity of how that sounds. The AFC is considerably more complicated and competitive. Even Pittsburgh and the LA Chargers will be tough outs because they field such formidable deences. 
              <br><br>              
              Dennis Allen was fired in New Orleans. No surprise there. When you lose to Carolina, that happens. Dennis Allen was a defensive coordinator and he'll probably get hired to serve in that capacity for some team next year. But he's not a head coach. Being a good offensive or defensive coordinator does not mean you'll be a good head coach. Josh McDaniels was a good offensive coordinator. He was not a good head coach. Steve Spagnuola is currently a great defensive coordinator. He wasn't a good head coach. The list of acclaimed coordinators who have taken an offence or defence to great heights one year, only too fail miserably from their role they have been chosen to lead, is long  It's a tough job and regardless of how talented you may be in one area of the game, there's no guarantee the success achieved on one side of the ball will translate into a winning vision or direction for a team. Dennis Allen is the first of what could and should be a slew of head coaches to be fired, although most  will probably be given until the end of the year. Doug Pederson in Jacksonville, Antonio Pierce in Las Vegas, Matt Eberflus in Chicago, Zach Taylor in Cincinnati, Brian Daboll in New York. That's for starters, before we even get to Mike McCarthy, Nick Sirianni, Dave Canales, and Mike McDaniels. Because Brian Callahan is in his first year, he'll get a pass, but the chasm that exists between good head coaches (Andy Reid, John Harbaugh, Sean McVay, Jim Harbaugh, Mike Tomlin) and bad head coaches (any of the names listed above) is vast. A good head coach is, if not more important, than a good quarterback. It's tough to win the big prize with just one of the two.

              <strong>After ten years left unclaimed, not one, but two people, fielded perfect records last week to claim the free steak dinner. 17-0, including the ps and the db.</strong>
              <br><br>              
              <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Matt and Brett, congratulations!</strong></span> 
              <br><br>              
              <strong>AK, also known as Adam Kenny</strong>, was blotched fourth-down in Seattle from making it three. To give you any idea of how faint the chances of selecting a perfect week is, outside the fact of correctly picked the outright winner in 15 games, consider that no team since they started keeping records on these things back in 1970, had ever won after getting out-gained an opponent by more than 150 yards, having the opponent rush for more than 150 yards and lose the turnover battle. Teams that had those numbers on their side were 250-0 until Sunday. Then came Dennis Allen. Any given Sunday is more than a cliche. 
              <br><br>              
              Matt is my nephew on Vancouver Island. We'll have more than ample time to arrange a steak dinner, if not in the next few months, at some other time down the line. Brett has been the Pick'em for several years, but we never personally met. He may have already decided after reading the schlop I serve up every Wednesday, he doesn't care to know me, let alone share a free steak dinner with me. We'll talk. All that said, huge kudos to you guys. As I say, the free steak dinner was on offer for anyone who put up a perfect score for more than a decade. This is the first time it's happened. 
              <br><br>             
              This is written on Tuesday because that's when the Wednesday Report is now written and Tuesday, November 5 is a big day; one of the biggest days of my life and all I can do is sit on the sidelines looking in. Not meaning to be too bombastic, but to steal a line from Gladiator, the decisions Americans make on Tuesday will "echo into eternity". Yeah, the stakes are high. We can only hope they make the right decision. You'll probably know the results by the time you read this. 
              <br><br>              
              Talking politics these days is tricky business. I won't say anymore. I am now going to take a large sedative to knock me out until tomorrow and skip tonight. I was never this nervous when the Patriots played in the Super Bowl.
