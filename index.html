            <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>             
              There are a lot of rich storylines from the past weekend, but let's start with the team I love to loathe; the <strong>Dallas Cowboys</strong>. What a bunch of frauds. From their octogenarian owner who makes as little sense as Donald Trump, to the coach no one believes in, including his players, to the defensive coordinator who can't figure out why the schemes he drew up in the 80's are no longer working; if this is America's team, the United States is more deeply troubled and problem-ridden than I thought, without  even introducing the stark choice its voters will have to make on November 5. It will take the Cowgirls more than a bye week to expel the squalid remnants of yet another humiliating home loss.  Going back to January’s wild-card playoff game, that’s <strong>four straight home losses</strong> for the Cowboys, in which they were outscored 110-35 in the first half alone. It’s not just that they’re losing, but how thoroughly they’re getting obliterated. Although the Lions are a good, not quite great team, the Cowboys should never look like they don’t belong on the same field as an opponent, especially when playing on their own field. Sunday was the second time in this early season an opponent moseyed into AT&T Stadium and nearly hit 50 points. The Saints scored six touchdowns in Week 2, and the Lions lumped them up even worse. The loss was so lopsided the Lions took to trying various trick plays because scoring the conventional route didn't offer enough resistance. There's more than enough blame to go around. JJ is not only the owner, he's also the non-designated / de facto general manager. He knew they didn't have a running game. He let Pollard walk, but did nothing to address it. Would Derrick Henry not look good in the silver and blue? He was available. Jerry claims he couldn't afford it. $14 million is chump change when you're paying your star wide receiver $35 million and your quarterback in excess of $50 million. Hell, they're paying Cooks nine or ten mill for catching a pass a week. That's just one of a series of positions they need reinforcement. At the same time, it's difficult for Mike McCarthy to scapegoat defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer when the offence he's calling plays for is so putrid. There are only two teams in the NFC with a worse scoring differential, Carolina and the LA Rams. All in all, it's a clusterfuck.
              <br><br> 
              As for the Lions, that's about as bad as you can feel after a signature win. Their defensive stud, <strong>Adrian Hutchinson broke his leg</strong> and is gone for the year. Statistically, Hutchinson is elite and he's the central cog in the Lions defence. Big high motor pass rusher in the mould of John Randle. Different physique, but relentless. He's got 7.5 sacks. No one else on the team has more than 2.5. This is a mediocre defence with Hutchinson playing. Without him, there could be a serious drop-off.  The litmus test comes early with the Lions visiting the Vikings next week. 
              <br><br>
              So <strong>TB (Tom Brady)</strong> is doing the Detroit / Dallas game and he's getting better after six weeks on the job. He's giving you a little more about what he's seeing and what he's thinking. Anyway, yesterday, he was raving about the Lions offence and he said, "I'd love to be in charge of an offence like that". <strong>I tell you, he still wants to play.</strong> If the Chiefs, LIons or 49erers lost their starter, I'd bet he'd be on the first plane out to any one of those destinations. In the back of his mind, he's kinda hoping one of them does get hurt. He said it in a way he hasn't completely given up hope of playing football again. It says to me, he wants to play a hell of a lot more than he wants to broadcast. Mind you, that would further complicate his ambitions of owning a chunk of the Raiders. Can you imagine TB owning a NFL team? You currently have lots of owners who know a lot more about making money than owning a professional football organization. With Brady, you'd get football acumen and a built in winning culture.
              <br><br>
              Speaking of culture or lack thereof, the Jags lost again in their home away from home and looked brutal in doing so. <strong>Do you know what Trevor Lawrence's record is the last 11 games? 1-10.</strong> Just a couple years back, he was the can't fail, future Hall-of-Famer.  This past off-season, they gave him a huge contract extension more on the promise of what he can be more than what he's actually done.  And then I come across this little morsel. He's 21-35 (56 games) for his career.  Here's the list of quarterbacks who've played at least 55 games and won less than 25 games. Trevor Lawrence, Tim Couch, David Carr,  Josh McCown, Rick Meier, Daniel Jones, Blake Bortles, Charlie Batch and Josh Freeman. That, my friends, is an inauspicious list, something you don't want anything to do with. Meanwhile, from the couch to the podium goes Joe Flacco, another win standing in for the starter and tossing a pair of touchdown passes along the way, the eighth straight game he's done so. If I'd known he was going to start when I made my picks, I would have taken Indianapolis. And the team they beat, Tennessee, didn't take my advice and stick with Mason Rudolph. They went back to Will Levins who completed 24 passes for a grand total of 95 yards. Brian Callahan is trying his best to make sure he never gets a head coaching job again after getting fired from the Titans, which will happen, probably at the end of the season. 
              <br><br>
              The Jets weren't prepared to give Robert Salah that long. He's gone after five. Too much backroom intrigue to know who spoke to who at what time and what was said. Woody Johnson, who owns the team, says it was his decision and his decision alone. Oh, and by the way, he spoke to Aaron Rodgers the night before, but they didn't talk about Saleh. Right. Rodgers would sell his mother to the lowest bidder to get his way. Considering he doesn't talk to his family, I don't think that's a stretch. He threw wide receiver Mike Williams under the bus for his route-running in his post-game comments after the Jets third straight loss, his first with the new coach and offensive coordinator. Funny how he failed to mention he had the ball in the final minutes of each of those one-score losses and failed to deliver each time. He's a certified conspiracy theorist and likes to tell everyone he's the smartest person in the room, just not that explicitly. I'm not fond of the man. But you have to hand it to the Jets for their all-in mentality. On Tuesday, they upped the stakes and brought in Rodgers long-time Green Bay teammate, DeVante Adams from the Raiders. Adams is a coveted receiver and there was a lot of speculation of teams vying for his services. On paper, it's a great move and gives the Jets offence a whole new dimension. Spread the receivers five wide with Adams and Wilson meriting double coverage and who's going to stop the run?  Bring people into the box and get burned downfield. Pick your poison. In football, there's few things as dangerous as an offence that can pass and run. Not wanting to leave empty-handed after Adams jumped to the Jets, the Bills got Amari Cooper from the Browns. Not as high profile, but a good addition to a team very thin at receiver. The NFL season is starting to get very interesting. 
              <br><br>
              And then there's <strong>Lamar Jackson</strong>. He's <strong>eighth in the league in rushing and he's a quarterback</strong>. Hard to believe he's a two-time MVP and this might be the best football he's ever played. It seems I say that every year. Each year, he's in a different situation with different players and it provides him just another opportunity to unveil abilities we didn't know he had. Think back 18 months. He's in a contract stand-off with Baltimore and no one, not one single team was willing to take a chance on him and give him the fully-guaranteed money he was seeking, something comparable to the DeShaun Watson contract. 
              <br><br>
              Speaking of, there was a caption during the Philadelphia - Cleveland game that said the <strong>Browns were 0-26 in third-down conversions</strong> in recent games. That seems impossible. 0-26 on third and 10 I could buy, but even that seems improbable. There could be defensive holding or pass interference, roughing the passer. Hell, they could possibly complete a pass. Nonetheless, they're sticking with Watson because Jimmy Haslan says so. The best thing that could happen is DeShaun gets hurt. You're still playing him, but Jameis Winston would at least give the team a chance to win. 
              <br><br>
              Are we sleeping on the <strong>Tampa Bay Bucs</strong>? They <strong>put up 51 points and almost 600 yards of offence</strong> on Sunday. Granted, they were playing a Saints team that has lost four on the trot and has been completely rudderless after winning their first two. Baker is still wildly inconsistent. The highs are sky-high, where he looks like a top ten quarterback, but the lows are DeShaun Watson-like. He had three interceptions in the second quarter so you can never be sure what Baker you're going to get, quarter to quarter, game to game. They've found a running game to complement a potent passing threat with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. 
              <br><br>
              There's a lot more to say, but hopefully I've given you something to chew on. <strong>Another early Sunday morning from London</strong>. It's a stinker with New England at Jacksonville so I wouldn't encourage you to watch it, just not to forget to submit your pick on time. 
              <br><br>
              <strong>The Disruptor Point Spread Game of the Week</strong> is a Super Bowl rematch; <strong>Kansas City at San Francisco</strong>. With the spread not likely factoring into it, picking the winner is a two-point game.
