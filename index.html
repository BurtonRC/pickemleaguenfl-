            <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>
              I'll get the big stuff out of the way so I can delve into my wheelhouse: the dull, banal and mundane. I didn't give it any hype last week and for that I apologize, but Canada had its national football championship on Sunday. the Grey Cup. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers were playing in its 5th consecutive Grey Cup. They lost their third in a row. They were leading 10-9 at the half and then it all went south, losing 41-24. Bomber quarterback Zach Collaros, once again waited until the last game of the year to serve up one of his worst of the season, although there was lots of blame to go around; coaches, defence, special teams, mascots, cheerleaders, fans. Never content to let another city outshine its own humility, Winnipeg is gunning for Buffalo as the only team to lose its national football championship four times in a row.
              <br><br>
              In the NFL, those same Buffalo Bills took a big step to getting back to the big game after a 30-year hiatus. They beat previously undefeated Kansas City by letting their best player win it for them on a crucial fourth down play.  Even if the play didn't work, it was the correct decision. Putting the game in Patrick Mahomes hands, which the Bills know better than anyone, is never a good idea. The Bills won because they weren't afraid of failing, and for that, they were rewarded. People could apply that same lesson to their own  lives. In the other two big AFC tilts, Baltimore did what it's done four times this year; find ways to lose a game. In this case, 12 penalties, five turnovers, and a botched game-tying two-point conversion in the final minute. Yes, missed field goals are turnovers. You turned the ball over on downs. That is a turnover. Anyway, I strongly contend that Baltimore is a far superior team to Pittsburgh. They may have dimmed their chances of winning the AFC Central, but they remain uber-dangerous, on the road or at home come playoff time. As for the Bengals/Chargers game, which would pull me away from the Bombers dumpster fire happening on the other channel, the Chargers proved they aren't the same old Chargers. For years, hell decades, squandering a three-touchdown lead in the second half would hardly be a blip in the team’s long history of debilitating losses. This year, it is the Chargers not being the team that missed two field goals and gave up the game-winning touchdown with seconds remaining. When it looked like overtime was imminent, Jim Harbaugh did what Sean McDermott did earlier in the day; put the game in the hands of the team's best player. Still can't get a read on the Chargers. They looked like world-beaters in the first half, only to mail in a feckless effort in the second half, minus the last minute-heroics. I refuse to count Cincinnati out until they are officially eliminated. Joe Burrow is too good not to be in the playoffs. 
              <br><br>
              The Dallas Cowboys lost again on Monday night. As far as recent, lopsided, embarrassing Cowboys losses go, this one barely registers. A piece of metal fell from the roof before the game, which is somehow so fitting and emblematic of the entire Cowboy year. At 3-7, the Cowboys’ 2024 season is dead. What we don’t know is their plan for 2025 and beyond. Mike McCarthy iis in the final year of his contract. Most people assumed that if this season didn’t go well, Jerry Jones would pull the plug on McCarthy. Don't count on it. For Jones, the priority isn't building a Super Bowl contender. It’s about Jones enjoying his experience as the owner of the Dallas Cowboys and making boatloads of money in the process. That means employing a coach who understands the setup. Someone who isn’t going to challenge him. Someone who isn’t going to ask for influence on personnel decisions. Someone who is going to be OK with Jones holding media scrums after every game and saying outlandish things during his weekly radio appearances. Head coach of the Cowboys is not a job for everyone, and might well not be a job that attracts top candidates.
              <br><br>
              Which brings us back to McCarthy. Returning really doesn’t feel that far-fetched. Jones stuck with Jason Garrett for 10 years even though Garrett produced only two playoff wins. Why? Not because Jones thought Garrett was the best man for the job, but because he was comfortable with Garrett as his head coach. Jones could easily rationalize bringing McCarthy back. He could explain that only the Chiefs won more regular-season games than the Cowboys from 2021 to 2023. That the team was hit with the injury bug and got unlucky in 2024. That McCarthy is still the best man for the job and just needs some more time to work with Dak Prescott to get them over the hump. I can totally see this happening. Can’t you? I’m not saying it’s going to play out this way, but when you hear McCarthy bluster about this and that in the weeks ahead, just remember: In Dallas, it’s not about winning. It’s about Jerry. That’s the one thing that’s not going to change.
              <br><br>
              Sean Payton is arrogant and can be more than a little annoying. He seems to think he’s god’s gift to football, and he will tell you that he thinks he’s god’s gift to football. He's so smug that anyone outside of Denver hoped his second head-coaching job would take him down a peg or two. Last season was a mess, and then Payton spent the 12th pick in the draft on an over-aged quarterback. All the pieces were in place for disaster. Trouble is, Sean Payton is a good coach. BoNix has outperformed expectations and not all of that is Bo Nix. Caleb Williams has underperformed in Chicago and not all of that is Caleb Williams. The same goes for Anthony Richardson. Denver's over/under win total was 5.5. After Week 11, the Broncos are 6-5. Simply put, player development is an important part of good coaching. I’m not telling you that the Broncos are a Super Bowl contender, but they have exceeded expectations. And Payton deserves the credit. If asked, he'd probably tell you that.
              <br><br>
              Netflix has a special coming out on Aaron Rodgers in December. You have to imagine when they gave this project the green light, this wasn't the scenario they envisioned. They saw the Jets being good and a film crew tagging along chronicling the wondrous things Rodgers was doing to make the Jets a championship-calibre team. Does anyone want to hear one minute of Rodgers, let alone a two-hour documentary, at this point? Until recently, Pat McAfee would give Aaron an hour a week to talk about whatever he wanted: shoot down the coach, throw teammates under the bus, conspiracy theories, his favourite breakfast cereal. Not even Pat wants to talk to him now. He's a disaster. He's in the final stage of quarterbacking where getting rid of the ball before he gets hit is more important than the results of the play. Here are the winning percentages of past Jets starters: Zach Wilson - ,364, Sam Darnold - ,342, Aaron Rodgers - .273. Sit down, you phoney. He led anyone who would listen, he'd lead the Jets to the promised land. He's a fraud. He brought along all his former friends and players, got the coach fired, and earlier this week, got the GM fired. One the best defences in the league decided they tired of the whining and are now middle of the pack or worse. Has there been any accountability? Of course not. People have already begun speculating whether he'll be back next year. I don't know if he'll be back after their bye. See, this is where he presents the phantom injury that prevents him from playing out the rest of the year. He can blame it on the turf at Metlife. When he couldn't play last year, he pined because he couldn't show New Yorkers how spectacular he was. Now that they see what a huckster and fraud he is, he wants to back out of the limelight as quickly as he can. Come on smart guy. You're so well-read you have to tell everybody about it all the time. Tell us how you single-handedly created the conflagration that is the Jets? Maybe he can work for the new Trump administration. Be the ambassador for ayawaska.
