            <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>
              Some quick thoughts. <span style="color: crimson; font-weight: bold;">It was my birthday this week</span>üéâüéÇüéÅ and I didn't have a lot of free time considering it turned into a three-day bout of debauchery and depravity, Rolls in the park, a family dinner; it was completely out of control. This is all I have time for.
              <br><br>
              The early slate of games on Sunday was magnificent.. Six of the eight games were decided by five points or less and four of those games had game-winning scores in the last minute. I don't watch "The Red Zone". I'm more of a football purist, but Scott Hansen must have been going wild in the Witching Hour. Going quadbox while doing lines of coke under the table. To be as animated and high-adrenaline as Scott requires more than what a steady flow of espresso can deliver.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Biggest losers of the Week:</strong>
              <br><br>
              <strong>[a] Chicago Bears - </strong>They were eight seconds away from winning a game they had no right winning. The other team has no timeouts and the ball at their own 30.
              <br><br> 
              Rule one: Protect the sideline. Anything in-bounds and the game is over. Washington had to get the ball to midlield to even attempt a Hail Mary and the Bears give them an uncontested 18 yard out to stop the clock. How does that happen? What is the coach thinking? And if that wasn't bad enough, the next play was worse. You've seen it a hundred times and doesn't need further explanation. It's hard to win games in the NFL. Don't beat yourselfs. Handing balls to an offensive lineman at the 1-yard line? That's the best call in your playbook to punch it from the 1? How did that even get into the playbook? Had they even practiced the play? It certainly didn't look like it. This was coaching malfeasance.
              <br><br> 
              <em>Players win games. Coaches lose them.</em> - <strong>Bill Belichick</strong>
              <br><br>
              <strong>[b] New York Jets - </strong>Through eight games, the Jets have scored two more points with Aaron Rodgers at quarterback than they did last year with Zach Wilson at quarterback. They've lost three straight after firing Saleh and have given up 62 points in the last two games to a pair of the worst offenses in the league. They let the Patriots back-up Jacoby Brissett, who can't run and has trouble throwing a ball more than 15 yards downfield, drive the field in the final three minutes. The Jets defence, which was the only thing half-decent with Saleh in charge, has gotten worse. DeVante Adams has done nothing since he arrived when it's offensive linemen they should have been acquiring. Greg "the leg" Zuerlein has probably cost them a couple games and missed another field goal and an extra point on Sunday. They're 2-6 and the Aaron Rodgers gamble has proven a colossal failure. I don't think he's coming back and if he does, they'll miss the playoffs again. They're not just a badly run team. They're a badly run organization.
              <br><br>
              <strong>[c] Tennessee Titans -</strong> Some say the NFL acronym stands for "Not For Long", which could be used to apply to Brian Callahan's coaching career. You can't attribute all player mistakes to bad coaching, but when you give up a 90-yard kickoff return, a 70-yard punt return, a 64 yard punt return called back for a block in the back, a further 44 yard punt return, plus another four turnovers, it is a reflection of how you run your team. Is it any wonder they lost 52-14? Dan Campbell probably called off the dogs or it could have gotten uglier. At halftime, the Lions had nine passing yards and 35 points. The Titans weren't just bad this week. They are consistently bad every week. I can't imagine them winning another game unless Carolina comes calling. Just as I say that I see the Titans play the Patriots at home this weekend. That's not to be missed.
              <br><br>
              <strong>[d] Indianapolis Colts -</strong> Anthony Richardson stat line against Houston - 10 for 32 for 170 yards and five sacks, he has a 44 percent completion record, the worst in the NFL this year.  Since 2000, there have been 826 quarterbacks. AR is 823rd of quarterbacks in pass completion percentage of those who threw at least 100 passes. He's wildly inaccurate and is constantly throwing into tight windows. Whether it be bad decision-making or a lack of experience, he's not ready to be an NFL quarterback. Back-up Flacco should start. He has started in two games replacing an injured Richardson and threw 7 touchdown passes and one interception. Richardson has started six games  and has thrown 4 touchdown passes and has thrown 7 interceptions. Head coach Shane Steichen has repeatedly said, "Anthony Richardson gives our team the best chance to win". The fact is, he doesn't. He cost them the game on Sunday and several other winnable games earlier in the season. I understand he's a fifth overall pick, and you want to hand him the reins, but not if he's driving the team into a ditch.
              <br><br>
              <strong>[e] Baltimore Ravens</strong> - How many fourth quarter leads can a good team give up before you question their ability to close the deal, They are last in the league in defending passes inside the numbers and are second-highest in allowing explosive plays off those throws. You can't win championships with those numbers, The Browns moved the ball with ease considering they started their back-up, Jameis Winston, and traded away their best receiver last week, The Ravens are now 5-3, with losses to a pair of 2-6 teams, and have surrendered home field advantage in the playoffs considering the Chiefs are 7-0. The Ravens are a Super Bowl calibre team, but they have to clean up their back end to avoid another year of playoff failure.
