              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>             
              Barring losing two of their last four, KC has homefield through the AFC playoffs. Don't kid yourself, the Chiefs won't let this opportunity slip away. Although they wished they could have banked some of their good fortune through 13 weeks, the truth is they needed all of it to be in the position they are. It won't matter. They simply don't have the talent to beat Baltimore or Buffalo, one of whom I fully expect to be the other team standing when we get to the conference championship.. That, provided the Chiefs don't play one of those teams after their bye in the first round of the playoffs. They won't beat either of those teams. It's been a good run, a great run, but will fail short of being truly historic by failing to win a third Super Bowl title in a row. They're going to Cleveland this weekend, which is 3-10. The Chiefs are giving 4 points. That's about all you need to know. 
              <br><br>
              Despite losing 44-42, in one of the great games or the season, my belief in the Bills isn't shaken. Yeah, the defence stunk playing on a fast-track in LA. The only fast tracks in the AFC playoffs are Houston, and in long-shot odds, Indianapolis. Or Miami, who is statistically, still alive. None of those teams pose a threat to Buffalo, Baltimore, KC or Pittsburgh. Sean McDermott is a lauded and highly-respected football coach. Doesn't mean he doesn't make boneheaded calls. Why did Josh Allen try to push it in from the one in the final minute when the Bills only conceivable way to a highly unlikely victory was retaining their three timeouts? That's a no brainer. That Joe Brady called it, Sean McDernptt didn't overrule him and that Josh Allen didn't audible out of the call speaks badly of all three, but most of all, McDermott. That is his call. He hears all the calls, offensive coordinator Brady relays to Allen, He had the chance to veto it. Instead, he let it play. You can get up to two pass plays in the end zone in eight or nine seconds. You score, or the clock stops. That is situational football. You hear the term bandied about constantly. It's calls like that that kill you in the playoffs. You don't need an armchair quarterback in a wheelchair in a foreign country to tell you that. 
              <br><br>             
              As for the Rams, they control their own destiny. Win their remaining four games and they're in. At San Francisco and New York against the Jets, and then back home for their final two against Arizona and Seattle. The final game against Seattle at home will probably be for the NFC West, although both teams remain alive in the wildcard chase. No one in the NFC playoffs wants to play the Rams. No one, including Detroit and Philadelphia. Philadelphia was shockingly bad in their win against Carolina. They passed for less than 100 yards. They have an MVP in their backfield, two star wideouts, a good offensive line that provides him ample time to throw, and yet they're 30th in giving up sacks. Jalen Hurts has to start earning that $50 mil a year salary, You can't hang on to the ball until a receiver runs clear. Being anticipatory and running a receiver into open spots is what a good quarterback can and should do,  The Eagles are 11-2 in spite of him, not because of him. They play Pittsburgh on Sunday. Pittsburgh hasn't won in Philadelphia since 1955. The Steeler defence won't afford Hurts the kind of time Carolina did.

              That's all I made time for. I may be lazy, but I'm honest.
