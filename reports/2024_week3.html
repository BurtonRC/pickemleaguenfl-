        <p>
          <strong>Even  you don't read the Wednesday Report, please read the highlighted paragraph at the bottom before the Weekly Standings. It's important. Thank you.</strong> 
          <br><br>
          Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL. I wish I would have kept my old Wednesday Reports. Not because of the fine writing, but every now and again there is a nugget of useful information that can be applied to the current NFL. It must have been at least six years ago, but at the time I wrote that ESPN, by scouring through records for the last 20 years, had found that Week 2 of the season featured more upsets and underdogs winning outright and/or covering than any other week of the year. Their theory, simple as it was, was that early in the season, oddsmakers were basing numbers more on past performance (what the team had done the previous season) than on current analysis and indicators. Ergo, if you were good last year you'll be good this year, and concurrently, if you were bad last year you'll be bad this year. That, of course, is an oversimplification, but suffice it to say, Week 2 was a good week to go db hunting. Five of a possible eights dbs won outright and they covered in two of the other three.
          <br><br>
          Case and point, New Orleans. They have a mediocre quarterback in Derek Carr. Dennis Allen is a head coach with a winning percentage around .350 (roughly 6-11 per season): a very low number in the Wednesday Report QB/HC matrix, which I frequently see as the barometer of a good football team. Overall, an aging group with not a lot of upside. They beat up the Panthers in Week 1, but you can't put much stock in that. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers would give the Panthers a run for their money.  But in Week 2, the Saints went to Dallas and embarrassed the Cowboys. They scored touchdowns on their first six possessions of the game en route to a 44-19 victory. And five of those six scoring drives went at least 70 yards. Through two games, the Saints have outscored their opponents by 62 points. The offensive personnel isn't much different than last year, which was no great shakes, so what's the difference? Their new offensive coordinator is Klint Kubiak, son of Gary Kubiak, head coach of the 2015 Super Bowl winning Denver Broncos and who helped revolutionize NFL rushing attacks. Now how the hell is someone in a Pick'em league with a passing interest in football supposed to know that? We're not. We put our faith in sports websites that are supposed to know that Kubiak combined with Kamara gives you Cartumba! Through two weeks, the Saints offense ranks first in offensive success rate, expected points added per drive, and scoring. They have scored a league-high 11 touchdowns—four more than any other team. The Saints are 2-0, where few expected them to be and Ravens are 0-2 where no one expected them to be. 
          <br><br>
          For all the hoopla of having Derrick Henry in the backfield with Lamarr Jackson, it is understated, and not nearly as well documented defections of coaching staff that has contributed to Baltimore having to climb out of an 0-2 hole. Their defensive coordinator, Mike Macdonald, jumped ship and is now the head coach of Seattle. Their long-time, offensive line coach died of post-surgery complications in August. Like Kubiak coming into New Orleans, changing coordinators, on offence or defence, makes a difference, not always for the best.  The Ravens defence gave up ten points in the fourth quarter at home in losing to Las Vegas and were penalized 11 times for more than a hundred yards.  A lot of that is on the players, but a share has to be given to the coaches, who are calling schemes and.or making adjustments, that often fail to deliver the desired results. The dual rushing threat of Henry and Jackson hasn't gelled for any number of reasons;  injured or missing offensive linemen, drive-killing penalties and/or a dead coach. The three-game stretch in front of them could define their season; @ Dallas, Buffalo, @ Cincinnati.

          Old news, but since 2015. teams that start the season 0-2 have an 11 percent chance of making the playoffs. Projections now have these expected playoffs teams on the out, looking in.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Baltimore</strong> - Odds of making the playoffs at the start of the season - 78 percent / After starting 0-2 - 41 percent <br>
          <strong>Cincinnati</strong> - Odds of making the playoffs at the start of the season - 73 percent / After starting 0-2 - 43 percent <br>
          <strong>LA Rams</strong> -  Odds of making the playoffs at the start of the season - 45 percent / After starting 0-2 - 9 percent <br>
          <strong>Jacksonville</strong> -  Odds of making the playoffs at the start of the season - 40 percent / After starting 0-2 - 19 percent <br>
          <strong>Indianapolis</strong> -  Odds of making the playoffs at the start of the season - 26 percent / After starting 0-2 - 8 percent
          <br><br>
          I don't care that Barkley dropped a pass he should have caught, the Eagles loss last night was on Sirianni. The Eagles were up 18-15 with 1:46 left and had third-and-three at the Falcons' ten.  Atlanta was out of timeouts. This four-down territory. No if and/or buts. Even though Sirianni doesn't call plays, that message should have been conveyed to offensive coordinator, Kellen Moore.  Few coaches are as aggressive on fourth down as Sirianni, but when the time came for him to fully apply his convictions, he failed. Sirianni has essentially been stripped of almost all of his responsibilities. He doesn’t do the game-planning or play-calling on offense. He doesn’t hire the coordinators. And he doesn’t have autonomy on roster decisions. The one thing he does handle is game management—and he can't even do that right. They'd run the kush push twice in the game, easily collecting more than a yard and a half each time they ran it. If they ran the ball both times, and remember the play clock is running with Atlanta can't stop it, even if they don't convert it, which I find highly unlikely, the Falcons have less than 30 seconds to get from inside their own 10 to the Eagles 35 or 40 with no timeouts. And don't forget they'd already passed up three when they went for it on fourth down in the first half. If they would have taken the three when they had the chance, they'd be up six and this would be a moot point. They would have taken the field goal and made it a two-score game. I'm not even an Eagles fan and I felt sick about it. Owner Jeffrey Lurie is a forward-thinking guy. Sirianni is on a tight leash. If they don't make the playoffs, he's gone. If doesn't get a win in the playoffs, he's gone. The Eagles will have to play well from here on in for him to keep his job. 
          <br><br>
          Other quick thoughts:
          Kansas City could just as easily be 0-2. They have the best QB/HC matrix in the league and they know how to win.
          Carolina has been outscored 83-13 in the first two games of the season. They're benching Bryce Young. Who cares? They're in the Daniel Synder conundrum. Unless Tepper does something so outlandish even the NFL can't live it, the Panthers are stuck with him.
          Time to recalibrate our Caleb Williams expectations. He got picked twice and sacked seven times on Sunday night. If the offensive line play doesn't improve, he might not make it through the year. 
          The Patriots completed three passes for 18 yards to wide receivers last week. 
          The Steelers have scored one offensive touchdown in two games and are 2-0.
          The Giants scored three touchdowns and Washington scored no touchdowns, yet won the game. That is a first in NFL history. 
          Matt LaFleur is not a genius. Indianapolis knew Green Bay's game plan from the first snap and still let them run for 250 yards. Stack the box and force Malik Willis to throw. That's coaching 101. How Gus Bradley still has a job is one of the mysteries of the NFL.

          <strong>As I told you back in Week 1, the Wednesday Report and our Pick'em league are joining the 21st century. The Pick'em website will make its debut next week. It won't have the bells and whistles and graphics and videos of ESPN and other sports conglomerates, but it will house the Wednesday Report, and it will be where you will make your weekly selections. This is the final week of emailing your picks to me and the group. Starting next week, everything will be housed at the website. This will make my life easier and eliminate the weekly tally errors. Next week's Wednesday Report will be emailed to you. per usual, but your selections will be made at the Pick'em website starting next Thursday. The website address will be provided at that time. In some ways, it's kind of sad. I enjoyed being the receiver of the emails and gripes that come with being the Commissioner.</strong>

          The worldwide transfer of money app remains elusive. I will again serve as the treasurer. If you're in Canada, please send an e-transfer to <a href= "mailto: john.wyndels1@gmail.com"> john.wyndels1@gmail.com </a> if you haven't already done so. I will make arrangements with those of you in Ireland and the United States in the future.
          <br><br>
          I think that's all. If you do have questions, drop me a note. 
          <br><br>
          Regards,
          <br><br>
