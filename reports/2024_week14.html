              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>             
              We enter the final five weeks of the season. After this week, the byes are done and it's a full slate each week until the end of the year. Just a few thoughts on the past week.
              <br><br>
              I still can't believe Philadelphia went into Baltimore and beat the Ravens. LaMarr was 23-1 against NFC teams. Stats like that often don't tell the whole story, and for me, it was a case of under-estimating the Eagles and over-hyping the Ravens. Saquon Barkley has been great, but the Eagle offence is very much much on par with their offence last year. More running and less passing, but numbers-wise, very consistent with the overall offensive numbers they put up last year. The big difference has been the defence. Vic Fangio, the defensive coordinator, who I touted early in the season, has transformed the unit. After getting run out of Miami for working the defence too hard, he took his hard-nosed approach to Philly. The players have responded. After a 2-2 start, they've ripped off nine wins in a row. Barkley and the offence are grabbing the headlines, but the defence is more than carrying its load. The strength and conditioning of the team which came into question last year, when they repeatedly lost second-half leads, has the best plus/minus numbers in the fourth quarter this year. Every NFL game is a battle. But if you're stronger in the final fifteen minutes, you're going to win the close games. I didn't see anyone beating Detroit in the NFC, but this past weekend was an eye-opener. Detroit has a one-game advantage and they better keep it, because I can't see Goff and company going to Philadelphia in January and winning. Whereas, for the first time, I can see someone going into Detroit and beating the Lions. And it would be a terrible match-up for Detroit. A run-first team going against a depleted and suspect defence. Or a run-first team going against one of the best defences in the league that's getting better as the season moves forward. You want to be peaking in December and January, not October and November.  
              <br><br>
              For Baltimore, it was more of what we've seen in all their losses this year; self-inflicted wounds. Penalties, turnovers, giving up big plays and special teams. When this team is on, they can move the ball at will. More than enough to offset their deficiencies on defence. Truth be told, that was probably Baltimore's best defensive performance this year. Baltimore outgained the Eagles by more than a hundred yards and held Hurts to only 120 yards passing. If someone was to tell me those would be the final numbers for the game, I couldn't imagine anything but a Ravens victory. But the truth is, the Eagles have had more running yards than passing yards for the past five games. That sounds like 1970-type football. I keep thinking Baltimore will clean up their game, but we're in the back-half of the season. That is who they are. What I didn't see was the calamitous downfall of the best field goal kicker in history. Justin Tucker was Mr. Automatic. He had a better than 92 percent success rate for field-goals under 60 yards for his entire career. On Sunday, he missed two field goals and an extra-point in a 24-19 loss. He's missed eight field-goals this year. People have been calling for Baltimore to bring in another kicker, but Harbaugh maintains he's sticking with Tucker. What does this all mean? I can't see Baltimore overcoming Pittsburgh in the AFC Central, so they'll be on the road for the playoffs. I don't think that sinks the ship. They lost to Kansas City in the AFC Championship at home last year, for what good that did. I just can't rid myself of believing Baltimore is the best team in the AFC. Evidence, such as wins and losses, don't support that belief. I, true to my form, remain steadfastly stubborn. I can't quit Baltimore. Seeding and who goes where and when will tell us a lot.
              <br><br>
              Despite not selling Baltimore, I'm still not buying Pittsburgh. They put up more than 500 yards against Cincinnati and scored 44 points. Still not buying. It was the Bengals after all. A defence that has been consistently shredded week in/week out. Rusell Wilson is 36 and looking everyday of it. Put a little heat on him and that bird is cooked. Harris and Warren don't strike fear into any defence. Crowd the box and force Wilson to beat you. The defence is good and Tomlin will make sure they don't beat themselves, but this is not a championship-calibre team. They play to their potential. Unfortunately for them, that ceiling isn't too high. I could be proven wrong, but I can easily see them being one and done in the playoffs. I do feel sorry for Joe Burrow and have officially given up any hope of them making it to the postseason.  You only get so many chances with a franchise quarterback who is healthy and in his prime. Burrow has been fantastic this season—completing 68 percent of his passes with 30 touchdowns and five interceptions. A legit MVP-caliber performance—had he only gotten a little more help from the toothless Bengals. The good news for Bengals fans is he's 28.  The bad news is that the rest of the roster needs a complete overhaul, from the coach on down.  Bottom line: This was probably the last run for the trio of Burrow, Ja’Marr Chase, and Higgins, who will be lost in free agency.

              This is the worst Chiefs team that Patrick Mahomes has been part of. The script on Black Friday followed a familiar pattern. The Chiefs once again stunk, but somehow came away with a victory against a lesser opponent. This time, a botched snap by the Raiders in the dying moments with a field goal to win it. I'm not going to bore you with out-sized one-score victories and their abysmal plus/minus that is more representative of a seven win team than an 11 win team, but suffice it to say, if this team had any other quarterback, I’m not sure it would even sniff the playoffs, let alone compete for a Super Bowl. But the Chiefs are 11-1, which means they’re in the driver’s seat for the top seed in the AFC. If they hold onto that spot, they’ll get a bye in the wild-card round, and the road to the Super Bowl will go through Arrowhead. The Chiefs would be favorites against any AFC opponent if they’re playing at home in the playoffs. As for me? I don’t really believe in them. How can you?  Do they possess some special magic that allows them to win close games? No, they've been exceedingly lucky. But they’ve got time to figure things out. If Mahomes is healthy and the Chiefs have the no. 1 seed, they are going to have as good a shot as any other AFC team to get to the Super Bowl.

              That's it. That's all  I'm out. Until next week.
