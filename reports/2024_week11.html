        <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>             
              That was quite the weekend of football. More than half of the games were one score games with a handful coming down to last-minute make-or-break drives. Thank God, I'm not a gambler. The Pick'em is enough to get my blood pressure up. If I had real coin riding on these games, I'd be on heart medication. I could have easily gotten 7 or 8 in the Pick'em this week, but a number of games broke my way. Who knows? Maybe it's my year. Maybe it's Detroit's year.
              <br><br>
              By most metrics, Jared Goff has been in the bottom half of quarterbacking the past three weeks. During that span, he's either fumbled or been picked once for every ten dropbacks. That would spell doom for most teams, but the Detroit Lions aren't like most teams. They’ve not only survived this stretch, but they’ve gone 3-0 while scoring the most points in the NFL over that time. In a league dominated by quarterbacks—where dominant QB play is viewed as a prerequisite to winning a championship—Detroit has managed to build an offense that can be QB-proof if it has to be. Can you recall a team throwing five picks and still winning a game? I can't recall a game where a team has thrown five picks, let alone won it. Three, yeah, there were a couple of those this past weekend. How ya doing, Sam Darnold? Four. Steve Grogan and "Two-fisted" Tommy Kramer probably had more than one of those games, but in either instance, I can guarantee you the Patriots or the Vikings came out on the short end of the stick. But back to my point, if the Lions can win after losing the turnover battle by three, (Stroud threw a couple picks himself), their margin for error is considerably higher than any other run-of-the-mill contender. The Lions can adapt and shape-shift depending on the situation. It can win a shootout or slugfest or any game in-between. The Lions might be the one team that can win regardless of  the team's quarterback performance. As for Houston, the lustre was worn off the Texans we were all dazzled by last year. Missing your two biggest receivers and a non-existent running game can do that. They're 6-4 and a slam dunk for the playoffs by virtue of beating up teams in the AFC South, but a long way from being considered a threat in the highly competitive AFC. 
              <br><br>
              There are three games in the AFC this weekend that will go a long way to determining the playoff pecking order: Baltimore @ Pittsburgh, Kansas City @ Buffalo, Cincinnati @ LA Chargers. Entering Week 11, Pittsburgh hasn't played any teams in their own division. That means, two games against Baltimore, two games against Cincinnati and another pair with Cleveland. Their only other game outside the AFC North in the final eight weeks is Kansas City. That my friends, is no easy schedule. Division games are always difficult,  and I think Baltimore and Cincinnati are better than Pittsburgh, regardless of what their current record says they are. The Steelers have seven wins in the bag and another three would get them to the postseason,  but I'd favour their opposition in every one of the games, excluding the pair against Cleveland. Pittsburgh is never going to blow you out. That's not their game. Although the switch from Justin Fields to Russell Wilson has improved the passing game, jump balls to George Pickens and moon balls to Mike Williams are not sustainable on a week-to-week basis against better competition. They have a good defence and they won't beat themselves, something you always get from a well-coached team. 
              <br><br>
              Kansas City can all but nail down home-field advantage with a win in Buffalo. Easier said than done. Kansas City has conjured up more than its fair share of magic to maintain its perfect record. A different call, a different bounce, a different decision by the opposing coach and this team could be 7-2 or 6-3. Spagnuola's defence will keep the Chiefs in every game while Mahones is good enough to offset all the litany of offensive deficiencies. Kareem Hunt has been a savior for the Chiefs running game, which will get a boost with the return of Isiah Pacheco. However, it's the third of the AFC triple-header that I find most intriguing. 
              <br><br>
              The way I figure it, there's three teams (Chargers, Broncos, Bengals) vying for two spots. The Chargers have had a couple things go their way so far. One, they’ve had the easiest schedule in the NFL. And two, only Buffalo is doing better than them in the turnover department. Their defense has been very good. Quarterback Justin Herbert is playing well, and they are well-coached. The Chargers are in a nice spot with eight games left. There’s a scenario that could haunt the dreams of Broncos fans in which Sunday’s blocked field goal against the Chiefs ends up being the play that costs them a playoff spot. But Sean Payton’s team has overachieved. Denver’s defense has played well, and rookie quarterback Bo Nix is playing far better than he did early in the season.
              <br><br>
              But I’m not going to give up on the Bengals until I absolutely have to. They’ve been arguably the unluckiest team in the NFL. Let the game this past Thursday be exhibit one. Cincinnati is 1-5 in games decided by seven points or fewer. Only the Jaguars have a worse winning percentage in such games, but Jacksonville sucks, plays in an easy division against weaker competition and wasn't worth the mention. Joe Burrow is playing at an elite level, and Cincy’s passing game is going to keep the team competitive every week. If the Bengals can find some answers on defense (and that’s a big if!), they are going to have a chance down the stretch. 
              <br><br>
              What’s fun about this is that the Bengals play the Chargers in Week 11, and they play the Broncos in Week 17. Meanwhile, the Broncos and Chargers play each other in Week 16. In other words, we’ve got some high-stakes matchups coming up that will determine who gets in. Analytics, for what it's worth currently gives the Chargers an 83 percent chance, the Broncos a 53 percent chance, and the Bengals a 32 percent chance of making the playoff field. Things can obviously change, but right now, this three-team race for two spots in the AFC is one of the juiciest subplots of the final eight weeks. I don't think Pittsburgh has punched their ticket to the dance just yet. Week 18 - Cincinnati at Pittsburgh. Just saying. Predictions? I think the Steelers, Chargers and Bengals get in and the Broncos are the odd team out.
              <br><br>
              If that's the way it plays out, here are your quarterbacks in the AFC playoffs - Patrick Mahones, LaMarr Jackson, Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert, CJ Stroud and Russell Wilson. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more impressive quarterback list for a Conference championship.
              <br><br>
              Let's get some banter going or the Wednesday Reports will become highly ridiculous. Been pretty mainstream so far  We'll go stream of consciousness. Very Cookie-esque.
