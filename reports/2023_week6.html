        <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>             
              The collapse of the New England Patriots edition. It's selfish of me and somewhat cloying, but to fall from the unparalleled heights of success they rode on for two decades to back-to-back blowout losses the likes of which New England hasn't seen for more than 50 years, I think it merits comment. 
              <br><br>
              As mentioned before, I am a rabid and unapologetic Patriots fan. For a long time a source of pride (as if I actually had a role in their success), the Pats juggernaut is no more and has been gone for some time, steadily regressing from disappointment to misery and lately, downright disgrace. In the past two games, they've been outscored 72-3. How bad has it been? During the offense's last 31 possessions, which spans more than two games, the Patriots have actually been outscored, 22-3. That's three points for the offense and three touchdowns for opposing defenses. And that's just one of the statistical atrocities of the current Pats. For all the talk of how horrible the Bears and Broncos are, I haven't paid the Pats their fair due. We could talk about the pathetic play of Mac Jones, the absence of offensive playmakers or the mental mistakes, but more than a fair share of the ills and dysfunction of the team are directly attributable to Bill Belichick.  And that's hard for me to say being a direct discipline of the "In Bill We Trust" school of coaching. But Bill 's not just the coach. He's the General Manager. He's the Director of Player Personnel. He's the be-all, end-all of the New England Patriots. There is no one in the league that wields the control of one franchise like Belichick. And therein lies the problem. Bill's old school. Bill's word is the only word. Fall in line or seek work elsewhere. For years the my way or the highway way of thinking has cost the Patriots hordes of institutionalized talent; coaches, evaluators, and confidants. They all left because they weren't going to get a better job title in New England and found promotions elsewhere. Which brings us to the other side of the story. Belichick may run the team, but Robert Kraft owns the team.
              <br><br>
              There's the school of thought that Belichick has earned the right to go out on his own accord, that the architect of the greatest dynasty in NFL history can coach in New England as long as he chooses. For all the success Belichick has brought Kraft, the current situation is testing the resilience of that relationship. Under all of this is Belichick's pursuit of Don Shula's all-time wins record. Belichick is sitting at 330 career victories, 17 behind Shula's 347 wins. I don't see win 348 coming for a long time; a lot longer than Kraft has patience for. He's publicly lamented the team's lack of a postseason victory in the post-Brady era and has grown frustrated over the shortage of success. When Kraft hired Belichick in 2000, he was an forward thinker during a time when many teams were still struggling to navigate the new cap system. What was seen as thrifty thinking back then, would be called cheap now. For years he could negotiate better deals with free agents because of the lure of playing with Brady and the very real chance of winning a Super Bowl Championship. Those days are gone. He's failed to evolve. The examples are too numerous to name; failing to invest in a big-time receiver in a league trending in that direction while at the same time spending mid-round draft picks on special team players, an area of the game that is progressively being phased out. While other teams are constantly searching for coaches with new offensive philosophies and schemes, Belichick will bring back coaches who'd left earlier, recycling old ideas with underlings who are familiar with his top-down coaching style. Do you think it's any mystery why Matt Patricia, Joe Judge and Bill O'Brien landed back with the Pats while overstaying their welcome elsewhere. 
              <br><br>
              The fact is the Patriots are 26-29 since 2020, the 20th-best record in the league. More than half the league (18 teams) has won a playoff game since the Patriots' last postseason victory in Super Bowl LIII. Maybe the Patriots do find a way to buck these trends. Maybe they just weren't ready to compete with Dallas. Maybe they needed a wake-up call against the Saints. Maybe they'll beat the Raiders and catch a better team sleeping a week later to reshape their confidence. Then maybe they'll rally together as underdogs and remind the world they were once written off at 1-4. Enough maybes. The Patriots dynasty wasn't built on maybes. They were the better team on the field nearly every week for almost 18 years â€” outplaying and out-coaching their opponents almost every week. Now, they're second to last in point differential (-76), turnover differential (-8) and in current possession of the fifth pick in the 2024 draft, an indication of how far they've fallen. Being relevant this winter is out of the question. Which begs the question, what will Robert Kraft do? For some it may be intriguing. For others, who wish nothing but pain and woe for the Pats, it's nothing less than they deserve. For me, it's complete hell.

              I could say thanks for indulging me, but you never asked to be indulged with Pats lore in the first place and already seekingyour score viewing the upcoming schedule. The Wednesday Report will resume its normal operations next Wednesday.
