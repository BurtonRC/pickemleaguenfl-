          A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
          <br><br>             
          I'm not sure I'm a fan of two games on Monday, especially if one of them is Tennessee against Miami. I thought anyone who replaced Skylar Thompson would be a step-up. I misspoke. Tyler Huntley was abysmal. He'd been an adequate back-up to LaMarr in Baltimore for years, but on Monday, he looked lost. I'd put a fair share of blame on Mike McDaniels, who didn't properly prepare Huntley or his team. It's inexcusable for a home team to play that poorly on national television, back-up quarterback or not. One of Al Davis's great lines is. "We're an injury away from being good". The best thing that happened to Tennessee last night was Will Levins getting hurt. Mason Rudolph gives the Titans a much better chance to win than Levins. Brian Callahan should know this. He was a better quarterback than Pickens in Pittsburgh last year and when he had an opportunity to play, he showed it. Time to earn your head coach stripes, Brian. Sit Levins and start Rudolph.
          <br><br>
          Ben Johnson turned down a number of head coaching jobs to remain the offensive coordinator in Detroit. It was a good decision. He'll have an opportunity to be a head coach, but he may never have a better chance to get a Super Bowl ring than he has with Detroit. It's hard to play offense any better than Detroit did on Monday night. Goff was 18 for 18. The running backs were getting five a crack. Everything was working so well they had Goff catching passes. Seattle gained more than 500 yards so the defence has some work to do. Dan Campbell gives me cause for concern, but looking around the NFC, it's hard to find a more trustworthy team. 
          <br><br>              
          Is it too early to believe that Minnesota could be a contender? Don't let the final score delude you. That cheese-kicking in Green Bay was over in the first half. If the Viking punt returner didn't lose the ball in the sun, Green Bay would have never gotten as close as they did. The Vikings are really well-coached and they have a lot of things you're looking for; an above-average offensive line, a pair of quality wide receivers, including the best in the league, and a relentless, exotic and unconventional defence. I have to convince myself that this isn't the Kirk Cousins Vikings where every game came down to the final minute and winning by two scores was a pipe dream. The Sam Darnold Vikings are winning games convincingly. And playoff teams at that - San Francisco, Houston and Green Bay are not your garden variety cellar dwellers. The only team that didn't like Sam Darnold was the team that drafted him; the NY Jets. Both Carolina and San Francisco were very positive about Darnold. Carolina traded him to make room for Bryce Young (he was the first overall choice, remember) and he wasn't going to see the field in San Francisco with the Niners committed to Brock Purdy. This isn't the first time a well-travelled quarterback found a second home. Geno Smith and Baker Mayfield made several stops before finding a location and organization they could flourish in. For me, the game of the weekend is NY Jets against Minnesota, in the first of two London games this year. Don't forget this game starts at 8:30 (CST). I want to see if Rodgers can make the blitz-happy Vikings pay for an under-manned backend. 
          <br><br>              
          The marquee match-up of the past week was a lop-sided blowout with the outcome being so assured both teams went to their back-up quarterbacks in the third quarter. The Bills hadn't lost by double-digits since sometime in the '22 season and I didn't think it would happen even when they were down 21-3 because the Ravens are notorious for giving up leads. Wouldn't you know, their defence showed up for the first time this year. They may have been present at previous games in the corporeal sense, but they were really just going through the motions. They consistently harangued Allen and actually just looked bigger and stronger than the Bills; on both sides of the ball. The Bills defence is missing a couple core players and may have looked good the past couple games when they're carrying big leads. But when you're down three scores and you have to stop Henry and stop Jackson and stop Hill, they couldn't seem to match the size or the speed of Baltimore. We're just now getting an idea of how potent the Henry Jackson Hill attack could be. Henry Jackson Hill sounds like a very white law firm; the kind that has no moral scruples and would have no compunction about defending a reprobate like P Diddy, but I'm going astray. You can't call Henry fast because Tyreek Hill is fast, but he's almost like a train that gets momentum and that momentum gives him another gear. He's in his 30's, taken over 2500 carries and yet can still outrun younger, and what you would think would be more fleet of foot Buffalo defenders. To say nothing for trying to tackle him. It's one thing when It's the first month of the season. Think January, it's -10 and you've got his locomotive running at you. 
          <br><br>              
          Bo Nix throws for 60 yards and the Broncos won. I thought that was impossible unless your name was Eli Manning. I'll bet the Giants won a handful of games 14-6 where the defence / specials teams produced all their scoring. Eli's passing line would be something like 11 for 27 for 58 yards and a pair of picks. And they'd win! Minus his two Super Bowls, wins that would rank on par with the United States Miracle on Ice at the 1980 Olympics for unlikelihood, he wouldn't even be considered for the Hall of Fame. Completion percentage, touchdown / interception ratio, team winning percentage, leadership, general like-ability; he'd rank in the lower echelon of all those categories. Backpfeifengesicht: he's at the top of the ist. And they're going to send this guy to Canton. 
          <br><br>              
          Kansas City is like Houdini. They escaped again, but you're not quite sure how they did it. They've won four games this year with regressing totals each week - 27, 24, 22 and 17. That's not a good trajectory. In fact, they won their last 10 games going back to last year with a point differential of 61 points.  Christ, Miami beat Denver by 61 points one game a couple of years back. They're squeaking out wins left, right and center, often by the grace of timely turnovers, bad officiating, or opposing team screw-ups.And I don't say this to take anything away from them. They know how to win. They recognize what they have to do to win. It's a learned skill that some teams, especially coaches / general managers never learn. The Chiefs will probably end the year 14-3 with a +45 point differential, but they have Mahones and they have Reid, which gives them as good a chance as anyone when the margin of victory is so small. And their winning margin continues to get smaller and smaller with accumulating injuries. Their leading receiver, Rashee Rice, is gone for the rest of the year. Their off-season wide receiver acquisition to help stretch the field, Hollywood Brown, hasn't dressed this year and isn't expected to suit up from here on in. Worthy is Tyreek Hill fast, but he's also a rookie, without the college credentials of someone like Malik Nabors. Him, Juju Schuster and an over-the-hill Travis Kelce is all that's left. Oh, and their lead back, Isiah Pacheco is on the sidelines for at least another four weeks. They'll explore the free agent market, but one would assume that's slim pickings. The trade deadline is something like three weeks away, but you'd have to think teams would be wary of sending their gifted, but disgruntled receiver (DeVante Adams) to help feed the Chiefs glory. I won't call it a dynasty yet. That comes with another Super Bowl. 
          <br><br>              
          Plenty more to talk about that I'm not going to get to. Washington is the favourite to win the NFC East. After the pummelling in Tampa Bay, Sirianno's leash is even tighter.  Flacco comes off the bench and outperforms the starter in different cities in consecutive years.  
          <br><br>              
          If the Giants weren't such an unmitigated failure that nobody wants to be aligned with, the head coach of the Giants, Brian Daboll, would be doing commercials for Ozempic or some other misappropriated weight-loss drug. I hardly recognized him on the sidelines last Thursday. With a hat covering his bald pate and 50 pounds lighter than what he tilted the scales at last season, he looked like a new person;  it's not doing anything for the team, but he looks healthier.
          <br><br>              
          That's it. I'll admit I'm finding the new system strange, as I'm sure you are. The first week was going to be some headaches, which I think we've rectified. Hang in there. Only two dbs this week. If something's wrong, let me know. We'll try to fix it.
