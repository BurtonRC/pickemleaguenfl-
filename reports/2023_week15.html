          A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.

          There are a lot of things to talk about, but pressing priorities take precedent. For that reason, I don't have anything for you. I'm a bad commissioner and really should be decommissioned. 
          <br><br>
          In the final four weeks, you don't have to tell anyone who you're picking, besides me. Your selections can be a reply only rather than a reply all. As we get closer to the end, you might not want anyone to know who you're taking. Rick might not want Matt to know his picks and Matt probably doesn't want Adam having a peak at his. Let's call it discretion. For people like Roudy and I, it doesn't matter. Our chances of being in the money ended weeks ago. The long and short of it, if you don't want people to see your selections, hit reply. If you want people laughing because you're taking the Patriots over the Chiefs, hit reply all.
          <br><br>         
          With the exception of Andrew, it was a tough week for a lot of us. A reminder there are three games on Saturday, perfectly placed to disrupt the holiday weekend and get all married couples and/or partners on edge. I still have to collect outstanding dues from a number of you. You know who you are. Please check your score.
          <br><br>
          Regards,
          <br><br>
          <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>
          <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pick'em</strong>
