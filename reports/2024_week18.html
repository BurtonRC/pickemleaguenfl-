        <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>             
              I'm going to keep this short, as has been my habit these past several weeks.
              <br><br>
              The playoff teams are pretty much set. Denver wins against KC and they claim the seventh seed in the AFC. The Super Bowl Champion chiefs are getting 10.5 points. That's all you need to know. They're suiting up their entire practice squad and starting Carson Wents, Kansas City has no interest in winning the game. A loss keeps Cincinnati out of the playoffs. Having a weaker team in a field of seven makes their road to the Super Bowl a little bit less perilous. 
              <br><br>              
              In the NFC, we know the teams. We just don't know who goes where. Yes, Tampa will beat New Orleans and claim the NFC South. They could end up third or fourth seed depending on the outcome of the Seattle / LA Rams game. 
              <br><br>             
              The big game is Minnesota (14-2) at Detroit (14-2). The winner claims the NFC Central, the number one seed in the NFC and a first-round bye. The loser, despite a 14-3 record, falls to the fifth seed. Detroit needs it much more than Minnesota. They don't want to go to Philadelphia in the playoffs. They are at their best indoors on a fast track with their rabid fans in the stands. But make no doubt about it, the pressure is on them to win this game. For as much the Vikings would like to be the one seed, they're playing with house money. With Sam Darnold behind center, few had them pegged for the playoffs, let alone top spot in the NFC. Sam has earned himself a pig payday come next year. Anywhere from $45-55 million per year. I can't see Minnesota letting him go, regardless of how the season ends. What they do with their supposed quarterback in waiting, JJ McCarthy, who was lost for the year and opened the door for Sam, could be interesting. Being on a very manageable five-year rookie contract, the Vikings would be foolish to trade him away. 
              <br><br>              
              As for our little league, John H., Corey and Chris have set themselves in pole positions to take home the winnings. Good luck to all this week. I wish I wouldn't have squandered my best opportunity to win our competition, but c'est la vie. It's been fun. I hope you enjoyed it. I'll announce the winners early next week. 
              <br><br>              
              I think we should have a playoff pool again this year. Let me know if you're interested. I'll remind you with the note next week.
              <br><br>              
              Happy New Year. May 2025 be healthy and prosperous for us all. If you're going out tonight, <strong>don't drink and drive</strong>.
