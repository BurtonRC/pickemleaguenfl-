          A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
          <br><br>
          But we start north of the border where we lament the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 28-24 loss to the Montreal Alouettes, with the Als putting together a game-winning drive in the final minute, scoring with11 ticks left on the clock. Despite being a 7.5 point favourite and a 10 point lead at the half, the Bombers simply didn't do enough to win. They had a costly interception in the end zone and their defensive front, which has been a mainstay through the past four years, didn't provide consistent pressure to rattle Als quarterback, Cody Fajardo, who played outstanding and was deservedly the MVP. The Bombers have been in four straight Grey Cups, winning the first two and losing the last two.  In none of the four championships has Zach Collaros, the Bombers quarterback and two-time league Outstanding Player, played well. It was another sub-par performance on Sunday. Although Winnipeg ran the ball effectively, I just don't think running the ball on every first down is the right approach. The Bombers are getting long in the tooth and how much longer they can hold the team together is a big unknown. Collaros, Jefferson, Jeffcoat, Bighill, to name but a few, are at or near the end of their careers. It's been a good run, but to come away with only two of four championships, is disappointing. I guess I'm greedy because you know every member of the Bills mafia would give up their left arm to have just one Super Bowl from the four championship games they played in from 1991-94.

          What people have been saying since the beginning of the season was on full display Monday night. Kansas City has no receivers. Yeah, they have a number of guys wearing red 80 something shirts running down the field, but no one who can catch the ball on a consistent basis. Kelce is now 34 and if his recent MNF showing was anything to go by, appears more interested in fame and flying down to Brazil during the week to see his squeeze than winning football games. Kansas City is middle of the league in scoring and have an NFL-low 53 points in the second half this season. They were outscored 14-0 in the final two quarters Monday night, the third straight game they have been shut out in the second half. Mahomes isn't the problem. Anything but. Marcus Valdez-Scantling dropped what probably would have been the game-winner late Monday. For the record, that is his sixth drop of over 30 yards this year. And he still gets on the field? These might be the two best teams in football, but I have much more confidence saying that about the Eagles than I do about the Chiefs. 
          <br><br>
          We knew it was going to come to an end, and for all of us who had to suffer through more NY Jets prime-time games than we care to remember, it couldn't come soon enough. Zach Wilson is being pulled in favor of Tim Boyle, the qb3 who was signed, not because of his quarterbacking upside, as much as he is Aaron Rodgers buddy. He had more interceptions than touchdowns in college, but don't let that deter you, he is now the quarterback for the Jets. This was always what was always going to happen, and to pretend otherwise, as Robert Salah and GM Joe Douglas have, is ignorance. If you're a Jets fan, how do you stomach watching Joshau Dobbs join the Minnesota Vikings, without knowing a player or a play-call, and winning, while your organization sticks with Zach Wilson, when all the evidence to prove he wasn't a capable quarterback had been on display for the past year and a half? Hell, you signed Aaron Rodgers because you knew you couldn't play. Jets season-ticket holders should get their money back.  Not because they field a bad team every week, but because they were sold a false promise; a promise to be genuinely serious with Super Bowl aspirations despite the loss of the player who was supposed to take them there. Do you think Howie Roseman, the Eagles GM, is sticking with Zach Wilson when Rodgers went down in the first series of the first game? Do you think any GM worth his weight sits on his hands the entire year, when everything they need to contend is present minus a qb? And can we please stop with Rodgers coming back this year? Back to what? The Jets are 4-6 and are for all intents and purposes, done for the year. There's talk he could start practicing as early as December 2. Who cares? First of all, he didn't have a torn achilles. No one with a torn achilles returns after 10 or 11 weeks. So after he gets you to believe he's superhuman by returning eight months earlier than expected because of a misdiagnosis, he then goads you further into believing he'll come back and salvage their season when he has no intention of coming back to a season that can't be salvaged. Rodgers always thinks he's the smartest guy in the house.  Rodgers is playing his price of genius card and further marketing himself as the savior of the Jets to anyone who'll believe it. And who gets another prime-time, uncontested spot when the NFL debuts Black Friday? The gangrene Jets!

          "You guys act like we've never played good defence. That's not the truth. There are a lot of other things that caused us to lose the game today. It certainly wasn't our defence." 
          Brandon, your defence, the defence you call, the defence you came to Los Angeles to fix three years ago, just gave up 400 yards to the Packers. The Packers! They've been looking for a good offensive showing since Rodgers left town.  This a week after giving up 450 yards to the Lions, albeit a much better offensive team. They own or are close to worst in all the defensive stats you don't want to be associated with - yards allowed, points allowed, passing defence. And it has been this way for three years he's been the head coach. If he was just the defensive coordinator he would have been fired long ago. With the walls closing in, his defiant bluster at the post-game press conference indicated it's finally dawned on him that he'll be a head coach for seven more games. When you have the number of stars the Chargers do, including Justin Herbert, and your record is 4-6, you are the best dysfunctional team in the league.  With quarterback injuries in the AFC (Burrow, Watson. Rodgers) and level of mediocrity in the league, why are they not the sixth or the seventh seed in the AFC, at the very least? It makes you wonder if the dysfunction doesn't reach higher. While you have some owners like David Tepper that can't keep their fingers out of things, you also have the brain-dead scions like Chargers owner Dean Spanos, who doesn't see a problem when the problem has been parading up and down his team's sideline for the last three years? He's just too damn thick, lazy or iept to do anything about it.
          <br><br>
          I think the Seahawks loss to the Rams could cost the Seahawks a playoff spot. Sounds crazy when they're 6-4 and comfortably in the playoff picture as the current fifth-seed in the NFC. Have you seen their schedule? San Francisco, @ Dallas, @ San Francisco and Philadelphia. They're a 7 point home-dog tomorrow night and the spreads will only get worse in this four-game stretch. Suddenly 6-4 is 6-8 and you're on the outside looking in. And this with Geno Smith, who missed most of Sunday's fourth-quarter status for Thanksgiving  uncertain. Maybe they get in at 8-9, but they'll rue the one that got away. Like the Bills, who are 6-5 and have let three or four get away. Of their 6 games remaining, they have Philadelphia, Kansas City, @ Dallas, Miami. The Cowboys and the Ravens schedules are equally tough, but they've got some wiggle room. Something the Seahawks and the Bills don't. 
          <br><br>
          Yeah, the Broncos are 5-5 and some people at the Athletic are already projecting them to 9-8 and a final playoff spot. Get a grip. When they win a game without being gifted three or four turnovers, we can talk. 
          <br><br>
          Tricky Rick continues to put space between him and the rest of us. It's now nine points after another ho-hum dozen. The Survivor Series ends in a tie. Sounds like a cricket match, where they play for five days and call it a draw. In this case, it went 11 weeks, but both Brett and Daryl both backed Rowboat Ron and the Commanders to take the Giants. Serves them right. Rowboat Ron. 13 years as a head coach; three winning seasons. 
          <br><br>
          Like you hardly need a reminder, but we have three American Thanksgiving games tomorrow and a Black Friday game, which is such an easy-money grab it's amazing the NFL hasn't exploited it earlier. The early games (Thursday and Friday) are all dbs, but you better take one because the only other db all weekend is a pissed-off Chiefs team visiting the Raiders. Check your scores.
