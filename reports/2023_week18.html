        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Welcome to the Wednesday Report <span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 15px;">(tap and scroll text)</span></p>
        <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>             
              A few more quick observations.
              <br><br>
              Do you realize that if Buffalo loses, and Pittsburgh and Jacksonville both win, Buffalo will be out? Pittsburgh is a three point dog in Baltimore, but the Ravens have home-field sewn up. What is their incentive for playing hard? Do they rest their starters? Wouldn't they want Pittsburgh in the playoffs rather than the Bills, who I think are a better team and more of a potential threat to the Ravens? I think if Pittsburgh gets in and the Bills don't, it would be a travesty. Does anyone legitimately think that the Steelers are capable of winning a playoff game, let alone three to get to the Super Bowl? 
              <br><br>              
              Mason Rudolphis a markedly better than Trubinsky. It's not even close. Yet Tomlin started Trubinsky ahead of Rudolph repeatedly, each game a loss. If Tomlin had started Rudolph in the games Trubinsky started, we wouldn't be having this conversation because the Steelers would have already clinched a spot in the playoffs. Even if Pickett is ready to go this weekend, I would start Rudolph. He gives them the best chance to win. 
              <br><br>              
              Can anyone in the AFC, but the Browns, go into Baltimore and win? No. Don't see it happening. Lamarr is 1-3 in the playoffs and was very un-Lamarr like in all their losses. But this is a different LaMarr. A different offence, a different defence. The two constants have been Harbaugh and Justin Tucker, who are rock solid. Barring injuries, I can't envision this year's Super featuring anyone but the Ravens and the 49ers. All indicators put them a cut above the rest. 
              <br><br>              
              Despite how inconsistent Jacksonville is, I can't see them losing in Tennessee and winning their division. Lawrence has a litany of injuries, some worse than others, but as long as he starts, which he is expected as of publication of this rag, the Jags should win and claim the AFC Soft, which makes the game between Indianapolis and Houston for the final playoff spot. Indy is a point and a half home dog. 
              <br><br>              
              In the NFC, SF has home-field locked up, but the one team they don't want to face in the playoffs is the Rams. The Rams will either be the 6th or 7th seed, but they gotten better as the year has gone on. They have a good quarterback, a running back, and two good receivers. They have been a thorn in SF's side since McVay has been coaching them. They're the one team I can see going to SF and winning. 
              <br><br>             
              What do you do if you're Philly? Dallas will be up 14 by the end of the first quarter against Washington, so they're going to be locked into the five seed. Do you risk further injuries to your starters or do you play them because they've looked like shit for weeks and need the work. In my mind, this is the db of the Week. 
              <br><br>              
              Detroit has no one to blame for the fiasco with the two-point conversion in Dallas last week, but themselves. Three people checked-in, only 70 reported as eligible, and yet 68 catches the pass. Dallas wasn't covering 68 because he never reported as eligible. Does 68 tell the refs he was eligible or are we to believe that Campbell told the refs they were going to do something like this ahead of time and the refs should have been fully prepared with the numbers in their back pocket ahead of time? it doesn't work like that. There's a play clock. All of this is happening in real time, fast-like. You're dealing with referees who screw-up five to ten plays per week. And you want to put all your faith in them? Why should we be surprised they got this one wrong, if they did? The only ones who knew what was said were the players checking in and the refs.  Maybe don't go for the two points at the 7? Maybe don't make the two-point conversion a trick-play? Even the Philly special, which was a genuine trick-play, never involved ineligible receivers reporting in and hoping the refs got it right. 
              <br><br>              
              You know how you solve this? Make the refs NFL employees. 
              <br><br>              
              Detroit would have never had a chance to win the game if McCarthy wasn't such a bonehead. Dallas has the ball inside two minutes. Detroit has one time-out and Dak is throwing 40 yard outs? They gave Detroit an extra 40 seconds to drive down the field, which they needed. I have no faith in McCarthy. I've been quiet about him all year, but you had to know something like this was going to happen. He leads the league in "What the fuck moments?" You're watching the game and its just like, "What the fuck are you doing?" How can someone, who's been a head coach for however long he's been one, still make those kinds of mistakes, the mistakes that cost you football games.. They don't have a running game, Jerry Jones is your owner and Mike McCarthy is your coach. You're not winning the Super Bowl. 
              <br><br>              
              Do I really care who wins the NFC Soft? I like more teams making the playoffs because there are more playoff games. But Tampa Bay, Indianapolis, New Orleans? You dreaded having to watch them during the regular season. Now I have to be tormented by watching them in the playoffs?
              <br><br>              
              Bill Belichick should remain with the Patriots. He shouldn't become the winningest coach in NFL history while coaching another team. Dallas (because McCarthy should be fired), Washington or the Chargers aren't going to give him GM, as well as coaching responsibilities. If Belichick won't relinquish his GM duties in New England, Kraft has no choice but to sever ties. I just hope it ends amicably. If he leaves, I hope it is of his own volition, and not because Kraft can squeeze a first or second round draft pick out of him? Yes, his general manager moves in the last decade have left much to be desired, but there are few, if any, coaches I'd rather have. on the sidelines on Sunday. You can't win with the quarterback play they gotten, either from Jones or Zappe. Buffalo was up 17 and Allen hadn't completed a pass. It was like that game after game. 
              <br><br>              
              While New England should do everything they can do to lose to the Jets to ensure a higher draft pick position, Belichick hates the Jets and has a 14 game unbeaten streak against them. 
              <br><br>              
              Tricky Rick is four up coming home. It's not insurmountable, but the odds are decidedly in his favour. Week 18 is tricky. You're never sure if the team wants to play or even has to play. Even though 90 percent of the games have playoff implications, it's hard to gauge a team's motivation when so many things are beyond their control. 
              <br><br>              
              Final results will come out next Wednesday with a breakdown of who wins what. I hope it's been fun. I enjoy doing this for reasons I'm often at a loss to say.
