        <p>
              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>             
              Winnipeg's wonderful weather preempts this week's Wednesday Report. The NFL stretches into the new year, whereas, our warm weather will be gone by the end of the week. Seeing 22 degrees on October 7, 8 and 9; it may not be a record, but it's bloody nice.
              <br><br>
              While I'm loligagging, Roudy has been coding up a storm. There are a number of new features on the website:

              <ul style="list-style: disc; line-height: 1.5; padding: 0 30px;">
                <li>New <strong>Comment Boxes</strong> on home and leaderboard pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Picks</strong> are tracked by your name, correct spelling required, so when you have more than one visit to enter picks, previous picks will be greyed out and disabled. <strong>Send Feedback</strong> if you have any issues with selections not disabling on subsequent visits or anything else. </li>
                <li><strong>DBs</strong> are sync'd with Game selections and vice versa.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaderboard</strong> now has "Prev Week" scores and "This Week" points added to the existing columns.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Selections</strong> can be deselected if you chose a game and want to come back to it later, up to kick-off.</li>
                <li><strong>Survivor</strong> page is updated and finito - <strong>Allan won!</strong></li>
              </ul>

              <p>Since Roudy doesn't have a proper sandbox for testing, he has to submit the form at different times to see if the code is working. Our apologies for the intermittent and unsolicited emails. I expect that will be drawing to a close within the next week or two, unless of course, we receive a flurry of requests for new features, at which point, Roudy and I will discuss and determine how to proceed. Easy for me to say. Roudy will tell me when he's had enough. 
              <br><br>
              I promise I'll have something for you next week, which you can enjoy, ridicule or downright ignore.</p> 
              <br><br>
              Regards,
              <br><br>
