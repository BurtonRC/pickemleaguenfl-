                A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL. 18 is important in two of my favourite sports; golf and football. There are 18 holes in a round of golf and there are 18 weeks in a regular NFL season. Other than that, there are no similarities. One  is a team sport, the other individual. One is governed by a clock, the other not. One is made up of athletic freaks dressed in decorative colours every Sunday.  Hey, that kind of applies to football players as well.  Anyway, for anyone who plays golf, take a double on the first and you just want to call it a day or start the round over.   The NFL equivalent of doubling the first is getting thrashed 40-0 in the first game of the season or losing your star quarterback just when the fun was about to start.  Unfortunately for New York football fans, there are no mulligans in the NFL.  (As a short-aside, tough time to be a NY sports fan: the Yankees suck, the Mets are worse, the Giants are worse than we thought and the Jets are heartbroken).  
                <br><br>
                The NFL has to be bummed that six Jets primetime games are scheduled sans Rodgers. The proof was evident Monday: The Jets-Bills bonanza was the most-watched “Monday Night Football” game in ESPN’s history.  I wonder if Tom Brady's phone has started ringing?  Or Matt Ryan's?  Or Phillip River's?  As much as Salah said Zach Wilson will be the starter for the rest of the season, you know he's just waiting for a better option to come his way.  The Jets can't waste a Super-Bowl calibre roster with a sub-par quarterback.  The NY Jets at Dallas in Week 2 was a pick'em.  The Cowboys are now favoured by 9.5.

                I'm going to keep it short this week.  Week 1 is wrought with over-reactions.
                <br><br>
                The top three seeds from last year’s AFC all lost in Week 1, two of them in ignominious fashion.  Josh Allen turned the ball over four times against the aforementioned Jets, while Joe Burrow threw for less than 100 yards against the Browns.  While Burrow missed a large portion of the pre-season with a calf injury and the Bengals are notorious slow-starters, Cleveland has Cincinnati’s number. They’ve won four of five against Burrow and 11 of the last 13 against the Bengals.  I’m willing to give  Cincy a pass.  The more detrimental loss was Buffalo and it followed a familiar script. The Bills can't run the ball effectively so Allen tries to take it all on himself, throwing to receivers that aren't open and taking chances that don't have to be taken.  It's one thing if you're playing Mahones and you need 27 to win. It's another leading 13-3 against Zach Wilson, the disgraced second-stringer who was the Jets whipping boy last year.  When Allen is on, he can look virtually unstoppable, throwing with precision and running like a raging bull. You want your players to be amped, but there was no need for Allen to play the second half like it's the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl.  It was completely uncalled for.  Safe, mistale-free football and Buffalo wins.  Allen cost the Bills the game on Monday.  I know it's Week 1, but this isn't an over-reaction - the cakewalk to winning the AFC East and a high seeding the AFC playoffs is no longer a given.

                Brandon Staley was hired by the Chargers because he was known as a defensive guru.  They have finished in the bottom half of the league in defense for the three years he’s been there.  They blew a 27-point lead against Jacksonville in the playoffs and yet he somehow retained his job.  He started his fourth season giving up more than 550 yards against Tua and the Dolphins. Tyrek Hill had more than 220 in sixteen targets.  The Chargers never once bracketed him and they never double-teamed him.  I was watching the highlights the other day.  I couldn't believe it.  It was child's play. <strong>Coaching Manifesto Rule 8:</strong> Don’t let the opposing team’s best player beat you. Force the other team to let their lesser lights get the job done. Let Waddle or Moshaert or whoever their third receiver is be the hero.  An explosive play is considered a run of 10 yards or more or a pass play of 20 yards or more. The Chargers gave up 18 explosive plays to the Dolphins. Top defences, like the Cowboys and the Jets or the Patriots, might not give up 25 explosive plays in a year. Chunk yardage after chunk yardage after chunk yardage.  The Chargers can be a good team, but even they can't overcome bad coaching.  Miami plays New England on Sunday night. I won't guarantee a Patriots victory. but I will guarantee you Tyrek Hill won't have 200 yards or 16 targets.

                Did you know, because I never saw it happen this weekend, that any player on the receiving team will be allowed to signal for a “fair catch” from anywhere between the goal line and his 25-yard line, rather than having to field the ball and face the wrath of the 11 players on the other team converging on him like a phalanx of merciless marauders.  After a fair catch, the ball will be placed on the 25-yard line just as it would after a traditional “touchback” in the end zone.  What the what!  In the past several years, teams have designed kick-offs to be hit high and fielded inside the 10 where coverage teams can wrap the player up before the 25, rather than kick the ball through the end zone and concede the ball to the 25.  Last weekend I saw several instances where a kickoff was caught at the 5, no fair catch, and the returner is buried under players at the 12.  Some coaches obviously didn't get the memo. <strong>Coaching Manifesto Rule 15:</strong> Know the rules, all the rules, and how to use them to your advantage. 
                <br><br>
                The league is essentially creating an incentive not to return the ball on kickoffs — a type of play reported to have a higher risk of concussions, although this evidence is sketchy at best.  This is the latest in a series of changes in what seems to be a prelude to eliminating it altogether.  It’s a terrible idea. No one likes it; fans, players or coaches.  It further undermines the blue-collar toughness that once defined football, not to mention that kick-offs have produced many of the N.F.L.’s most exciting moments: the Music City Miracle in 2000; Desmond Howard’s 99-yard touchdown return in the Super Bowl, or Gayle Sayers seemingly every time he touched the ball.  Football is divided into three parts: offense, defense and special teams.  Special teams is the aspect of football that has changed the least since the game’s invention.  Offenses have evolved in the past half-century from lumbering ground games to high-flying passing attacks that favor an elite handful of skill players. Defenses have done their best to adapt with a constantly changing set of sophisticated strategies. But kickoffs have largely remained the same, an area where effort can matter more than God-given ability.  The game is changing right before our eyes, with a steady and continual accumulation of rule changes that would make Vince Lombardi want to rollover in his grave.  Football can't be adjusted on a whim according to the logic of business consultants and risk-averse corporate lawyers. It is violent game with players and coaches and a fan base of millions who care about its continuity with its past. Evolution in the game can occur, but not through corporate, top-down, profit-driven governance.

                A few glitches the first week.  I inadvertently sent the WR to someone not in the league and omitted one of the entrants.  I straightened that away.  My apologies.  Remember to pick the PS Game of the Week twice - flat-out and then with the spread.  I do prefer you give me the game and then the winner, but if you choose to derisively snub me, at least give me the city/state/region and not the mascot.  Baltimore not the Ravens.  Give the Commissioner a little love.  Tough week in Survivor pool.  Two forgot their picks.  I think eight are already gone.  Tell me if you can't access the spreadsheet attachment.  Double-check your score.  Mistakes have been known to occur.

                Corey finds himself in a rare space after Week 1. A good week for a couple newbies, a rough one for some others.  It's early.  Don't over-react.                <br><br>
