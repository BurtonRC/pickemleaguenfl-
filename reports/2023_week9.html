          A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
          <br><br>
          Okay, too much stuff happening to go into too much depth, so let's let it rip. Let's start with Monday night. Talk about two teams going in different directions. The Lions have young stars all over the place; Gibbs, Hutchinson, LaPorte, St. Brown. Two years ago, the Lions were 3-13-1, but they committed to rebuilding the organization from the ground up, accumulating draft picks and assembling a new coaching staff. They're currently 6-2, the number two seed in the NFC and looking at their first NFC North Division title in decades. In the last 18 games, they are 14-4. I'm an old-timer and I can tell you the Lions have never strung together a record like that for 18 games. They're far from perfect, but it's hard to think of a happier, more encouraged fan base. After decades of scratching out a miserable existence on the outskirts of NFL recognition and visibility, the Lions have come roaring back. 
          <br><br>
          And then there are the clueless Raiders, 9-16 under McDaniels, who's proven for the second-time that being a good offensive coordinator does not make you a good head coach. They bring in a quarterback past his prime. Wrong. They spend big money on a prime-time receiver who doesn't want to be there while negating other glaring deficiencies throughout the team. Wrong. They refuse to trade the disgruntled receiver for a first-rounder or acquire young assets for Maxx Crosby, whose efforts are lost on a team that's stuck in the desert sand. Wrong. They're 4-4 and consider themselves still relevant in the AFC. Wrong. This is a terrible team heading in the wrong direction in every conceivable way. And while Raiders fans are loyal, blindly following a misguided scion as he picks up moves operations from Oakland to LA to Las Vegas. It's hard to think of a fan-base more dissatisfied with their football team. How's it feeling for you, Noel? (This was written before the carnage.)
          <br><br>
          Speaking of offensive coordinators charading as head coaches, I present Kevin Stefanski. Despite playing with a back-up quarterback genuinely challenged by the talents required to play the position, Stefanski has PJ Walker throwing the ball late in the fourth-quarter when running the ball wins Cleveland the game. Kevin, you're not the offensive coordinator any more. You're the head coach. This isn't about generating offence. Your job is winning games by whatever means possible. Seattle hasn't moved the ball in two hours and instead of winning the game with your best unit (defence), you put it in the hands of a person least-qualified. Daboll, the Giants coach, did exactly the same thing. It's windy, it's raining, it's miserable. Playing with their third quarterback. they're somehow beating their cross-town rival the Jets, 10-7 with less than two minutes to go. They have fourth and less than a yard inside the Jet's 20. Instead of putting the game in the hands of their best player, Saquon Barkley, who'd been their offence the entire game, Daboll puts it on the foot of a veteran  kicker who's been sitting on the bench beside the heater for the last three hours trying to stay warm.  He probably didn't want to be there anymore than the 80,000 on hand, including our defending Pick'em Champion, Fran, who flew in from Dublin with his family for the game. I'm sure the ticket looked a whole lot more attractive before Rodgers was side-lined and the Giants became a laughing-stock. It was horrendous in all ways; weather, quality of play, coaching. There were a lot of memorable stats from the game, like the Giants throwing for -9 yards all game, but the one I like the best; the two teams punted 15 times in the first half. Anything to add, Fran?

          Which brings us to what I'll call the dirty dozen; quarterbacks who either started or came off the bench for their respective teams this weekend and stunk.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Tommy DeVito</strong> - Not to be mistaken for Joe Pesci's character name is Goodfellas, DeVito was thrown into action when the Giants backup, Tyrod Taylor was knocked out of the game. I'd never heard of him, and after this weekend, I doubt I will again.
          Mitchell Trubisky - He was bad for the Bears. He's equally wretched in Pittsburgh. If the game to Jacksonville wasn't already lost, Pittsburgh fate was sealed when he came on in relief of...
          <br><br>
          <strong>Kenny Pickett</strong> - His stock is plummeting. First play of the game, wide receiver screaming down the seam 30 yards deep. Pickett overthrows. Then he underthrows. Then he fumbles. Then he gets picked. The Steeler defence gives him good starting position almost every drive and he fails to deliver points.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Jaren Hall</strong> - He came on in relief of Captain Kirk, who is sadly gone for the year with an achilles tear. He'll retain his place on the bench because the Vikings acquired at the trading deadline, the services of ....
          <br><br>
          <strong>Josh Dobbs</strong> - The Cardinal's starter since the beginning of the year, filling in for Kyler Murray, who is slated to make his season debut next week. The Cardinals were so happy with the job Dobbs did, they shipped him to Minnesota on the next flight out.
          Brett Rypien - I remember Mark Rypien. He won a Super Bowl. I don't see that in the cards for Stafford's backup.
          <br><br>
          <strong>PJ Walker</strong> - Cleveland is a quarterback away from being a playoff team. Watson's status is always unknown, which puts the ball in PJ's hands. Never a good thing.
          <br><br> 
          <strong>Dorian Thompson-Robinson</strong> - He's PJ's back-up, who snuck in for a couple plays. If he's lower in the depth chart than PJ, that tells you everything you need to know.
          <br><br> 
          <strong>Zach Wilson</strong> - Don't let Sunday's last minute comeback mislead you, Zach is average at best and will not get to the Jets to the playoffs. He can't process information quickly. The game moves too fast for him.
          <br><br>  
          <strong>Desmond Ridder</strong> - He was pulled at half-time and replaced by Taylor Heinicke, who in my mind, should be the starter all along. In addition to being a poor passer, he's fumbled seven times this year. (Again, written yesterday. They've taken my advice. Heinicke starts Sunday.)
          <br><br>
          <strong>Tyson Bagent</strong> - I'm more impressed by his father's arm-wrestling championships.
          <br><br> 
          <strong>Mac Jones</strong> - He retreated to usual form after last week's aberration. He can't be salvaged. Perhaps it's the PTSD of working with Matt Patricia and Joe Judge last year, but he's regressed considerably since his rookie year.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Jordan Love</strong> -  Another first-rounder who's not getting it done. Everything we heard coming out of the pre-season was, he's ready. No, he's not, not even close.  
          <br><br>
          I wouldn't take too much away from Cincinnati's convincing win over the Niners. We knew when Burrow returned to health, the Bengals would come with him. It was the Niners second game without Deebo Samuel or Trent Williams, two of their centrepieces on offence. Like most quarterbacks, Brock Purdy is more effective up ten points rather than down ten points. When the opposing team can pin their ears back because they know it's going to be a pass, Brock is not who you want behind center. Fortunately, the team seldom puts him in that position because they flashed this stat during the game, Kyle Shanahan is 4-28 when trailing by 3 points entering the fourth quarter. He's never won when his team is down 8 entering the fourth quarter.  But it's the defence that's gone missing. They acquired Chase Young at the trading deadline to help strengthen their defensive line that's gone quiet. The season is long with a lot of ebbs and flows. So while the Bengals were on the rise, they caught the Niners on a two-game tail-spin. Barring unforeseen injuries, I expect both these teams to play deep into the playoffs.

          The lucky gambler, <strong>Rick Halas</strong> continues to shine. One of the five alive in the Survivor Series, his sixteen spot puts him three clear at the top of the Pick'em. Check your scores.
