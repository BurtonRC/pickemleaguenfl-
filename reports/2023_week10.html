        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Welcome to the Wednesday Report <span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 15px;">(tap and scroll text)</span></p>
        <p>
          A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
          <br><br>
          We're at the half-way point of the season. Good time to revisit where I thought things would stack up. Let's see what John got right and what John got wrong. 
          <br><br>
          <strong>32. Arizona Cardinals</strong> - I can’t see how this team scratches out four wins, with or without Kyler Murray.  They’re the worst of a handful of God-awful teams.  Got this one right, although you hardly had to be a football savant to foresee their season. The Bidwells, who own the team (third generation), are, for the most part, loathed within the organization. That's not a good building block.<br><br>
          <strong>31. Houston Texans</strong> - First-year head coach, rookie starting quarterback.  Never a good combination.  It’s hard to have faith in the Texans. Wrong. Wrong. Completely wrong. CJ Stroud is the rookie of the year. He's got 14 touchdowns, 1 interception. Lots of cap space next year. Buy a receiver. Adams, Diggs, Brown, Hill - they all started somewhere else. They'll be a couple good ones available this off-season. A young team with a big upside.<br><br>
          <strong>30. Indianapolis Colts</strong> - Forget about whether Anthony Richardson is going to be good or not.  With or without Jonathon Taylor, there’s too little talent.  With Synder now banished from the league, Irsay is the worst owner in the NFL. They have over-performed, especially without Anthony Richardson, who will be good. Irsay is a bad owner. Says a lot of stupid things, but there are a number of bad owners.<br><br>
          <strong>29. Los Angeles Rams</strong> - After burning through draft picks for more than five years in an, albeit, successful quest for a Super Bowl, the Rams have 30 free agents on their current roster.   When they start 1-5 and Stafford looks everyday the 35 year-old he is, how long before McVay shelves Kupp, tanks the season, and envisions USC quarterback, Caleb Williams, at the controls? Wrong. They have an outside shot at the seventh seed in the NFC. Pachau has been a revelation. If Stafford can stay healthy and play all the games coming in, they've got a chance. I don't think he will.<br><br> 
          <strong>28. Washington Commanders</strong> - Belicheck, with six Lombardis in tow, is on the hot seat, while Ron Rivera is permitted to grind out another five win season to add to his inglorious coaching career.  He's entering, if not already well into, Jeff Fisher category, a world where through some unspoken edict one is given the ability to be a NFL head coach year after year, regardless of their win/loss record.  I suppose the new owner will give him another season before he kicks him to the curb. Anything short of the playoffs and Rivera is gone. They got rid of their malcontents on defence and got a second and third round in return that they should use on offensive linemen. Sam Howell has played beyond expectations, but he's sacked four of five times a game.<br><br>  
          <strong>27. Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong> - When Baker Mayfield wins you’re starting quarterback competition, the script’s already written.  Take your five wins, fire your lame-duck coach and start over. Baker has played better than I thought and they will probably beat the five win total I'd given them. but change is coming. The team is owned by the Glazers, another reason to hate the Bucs. And I say that despite my dislike of Man U.<br><br>
          <strong>26. Chicago Bears</strong> - Trading the first pick overall pick to Carolina was good business.  They got a boatload of picks and players to help refurbish a long, down-trodden team.  Fields might still know how to play.  He has a lot of believers.  Not sure I’m one of them. Mostly right. Fields can't play. If there's one universal law in football, in order to be a winning team, you need a good quarterback. Like deodorant, they can mask places where the team stinks.<br><br> 
          <strong>25. Las Vegas Raiders</strong> - Josh McDaniels second head coaching job is looking a lot like his first.  Short.  Even though it may not be all his fault, he’s the easy fall-guy for a team going nowhere fast. Right. It was exactly like the first. It wasn't all his fault because the GM and the OC were canned as well. I still think it'll be years before the Raiders are relevant again.<br><br>
          <strong>24. Carolina Panthers</strong> - Frank Reich is a quarterback killer.  His track record of burning through quarterbacks-for-hire in Indianapolis was shameful.  Look out Bryce Young, you’re next.  Their defence better keep them in some games because their offence isn’t going to win them any. Right. Reich is gone at the end of the year. Tepper, like all bad owners, can't leave football decisions to the people he hired to make them. Whether it was Tepper or the GM, they whiffed on Bryce Young. Be sure to tune in tomorrow - Carolina at Chicago. Field against Young. It'll be an atrocity exhibition.<br><br>
          <strong>23. Denver Broncos</strong> - Payton supposedly has Russ on a tight leash.  So when Russ doesn’t cook, then what?  You bring in the perennial back-up Jarrett Stidham to help save the day?  Good luck with that.  The Broncos will be paying for the worst trade in professional sport for years to come. Right. Russ's numbers really aren't bad, but nowhere close to what they should be for the ungodly sums they pay him. They're not nearly as bad as they were at the beginning of the year, but after losing by 50 points, up is the only place they could go.<br><br> 
          <strong>22. Cleveland Browns</strong> - Talent abounds, but we’re talking about the Browns.  If something can go wrong, it will go wrong.  Football’s richest contract (Watson) has to play a hell of a lot better than he was closing out last season, his first action in more than a year and a half.  You don't want Watson on your fantasy football team.  He's not the kind of guy you want to be cheering for. Right. They have amongst the best defences in the league, if not the best, and are being undermined by a terrible quarterback situation.<br><br>
          <strong>21. Minnesota Vikings</strong> - I can see them finishing anywhere between 6-11 and 11-6.  Take away their 10-1 record in one-score games last year and 6-11 sounds about right.  I think the offence can still move the ball.  The defence?  Brian Flores is a good defensive coach, but he’s not a magician. Mostly right. Every game they play is a one-score game. They're 5-4, but could easily be 3-6. Whether Dobbs can keep the offence moving is a big if, but Flores has been a magician with the defence. The no-nonsense approach he learned in New England doesn't win him popularity contests, but he calls an aggressive defence that the team is responding to.<br><br>
          <strong>20. Atlanta Falcons</strong> - The last thing the Falcons needed from this year’s draft was a running back.  But from all indications, Bijan Robinson is the real deal.  It doesn’t help them at quarterback, or with their pass rush or their secondary, or any of a number of places they could have replenished.  But they should have a stellar ground game. Mostly right. The one position they excel at is running back. But it's difficult to win with Ridder or Heinicke at the helm. That being said, it could be enough to win the NFC South and first-round home playoff game.<br><br> 
          <strong>19. Tennessee Titans</strong> - I think I’m giving Mike Vrabel and the Titans the benefit of the doubt, because I don’t see it.  An aging quarterback, a running back who’s best years are behind him, and a discontented high-priced free agent wide receiver looking to cash out one final time.  That’s their offence, aside from a couple other questionable bits and pieces.  They better hope the defence is staunch. Again, I don't think I was too far off. The aging quarterback has probably played his last down as a Titan. Henry is still a quality back, but his best before date has expired. Yeah, Hopkins has had a couple good games, but 5.2 40 runners are being quickly replaced by speed. They won't make the playoffs and I think 19th spot isn't that far off.<br><br> 
          <strong>18. New Orleans Saints</strong> - The best in a crop of really bad teams in the NFC South.  Carr is a definite upgrade at quarterback for the Saints and makes him the best quarterback in the division.  If Michael Thomas can start half the games, let alone re-emerge as a legitimate #2 receiver, the Saints might be spunky. That’s as far as I’ll go. I wish I could pick games as well as give yearly prognostications. Pretty close. They have a one-game lead and one of the weakest schedules heading home.<br><br> 
          <strong>17. New York Giants</strong> - They bet on Jones, not Barkley.  Although both are on the team, they gave the four-year contract to Jones.  High risk to back a quarterback with only one solid season on his CV.  They’ll stick with the no frills, button-down offensive approach that served them well last year.  They won’t reach those same heights, but could contend for a playoff spot. Wrong. They're one of the worst teams in football. They bet on Jones and it cost them. They're going to have a top five pick in the upcoming draft, flush with good quarterbacks. They'll get one, but Jones is still on the books and $36m he's owed next year.<br><br> 
          <strong>16. Green Bay Packers</strong> - They say the Packers have never been so united.  They knew what the source of dissension was, but until the off-season, were never prepared to fully embrace it.  Jordan Love will do just fine.  Throw in a couple young receivers with another year under their belt and a top ten defence and you’ve got a pretty good team.  Rodgers and the Packers had innumerable chances to get to, and win a Super Bowl.  It was time to zig. Wrong. Jordan Love hasn't done fine. He's done poorly. The young receivers haven't panned out as well as hoped. The defence isn't top ten. They are young, and will get better with reps, but they're not there. They have an outside chance at the seventh seed in the NFC, but I wouldn't count on it.<br><br> 
          <strong>15. New England Patriots</strong> - As anyone who’s ever read a Wednesday Report can tell you, I am a rabid, unapologetic Patriots fan.  Has the 25-25 post-Brady record been difficult?  Yes.  Are there better things ahead in 2023?  Yes, I believe there are.  Despite the toughest schedule in football, they’ll be a tough out.  They have a good, if not great, defence.  Their offensive line is a mess, but if Bill O’Brien can get more out of Mac and company, they could be a 10 win team. It doesn’t help being in the toughest division in football. Oh Christ, where to start. Mac Jones is an abomination. His passes look like helium balloons. The defence lost their two best players for the year and quit. I think Belichick has lost the locker room, which puts Kraft in a bind because this off-season he signed Belichick to an extension. He's the highest paid coach in football so he didn't come cheap. I could never have imagined the Pats would sink so low.<br><br> 
          <strong>14. Los Angeles Chargers</strong> - Why would I have any faith in the Chargers?  Because they brought Kellen Moore from Dallas to run the offence?  The offence was seldom the problem.  They never fired their head coach who blew a 27-point lead in the playoffs to Jacksonville, the latest in a litany of missteps that has plagued the team since he took the reins. Right. Brandon Staley should not be a head coach. Justin Herbert is over-rated and they won't make the playoffs. They're not the 14th best team.<br><br> 
          <strong>13. Pittsburgh Steelers</strong> - This is a proud franchise.  If I didn’t dislike them so much, I’d be a supporter.  Six Super Bowls.  Three head coaches in 50 years.  Not much to dislike.  Since the Cleveland Browns came back to the NFC North in 1999, they’ve never had a better season record than the rival Steelers.  That tells you everything you need to know about a successful versus an unsuccessful franchise. They ended last year strong and I expect that trend to continue. If the AFC wasn’t so stacked, they’d be a shoo-in for a playoff spot. Somewhat right. It's a great franchise and they have a great coach, but sometimes that's not enough. See New England. Until they receive more consistent play from Pickett, they're a .500 team.<br><br> 
          <strong>12. Detroit Lions</strong> - Are we maybe getting ahead of ourselves?  After all, we’re talking about the Detroit Lions, the most tormented least successful franchise in football history, and we’re suddenly anointing them NFC North champs and football’s newest sweethearts, co-starring in the season opening game?  It takes more than one playoff season to wash away decades of futility. Somewhat wrong, I think they're about 12th. I agree with everything I said about them last week. They have tremendous upside and have exceeded my early-season expectations. 
          <br><br>
          I ran out of time. Expecting company. The Jets shouldn't be there and the Ravens should be higher.
          <br><br>
          <strong>11. Seattle Seahawks</strong> - I’m big on the Seahawks.  They’re a playoff team that will contend with the Niners for the NFC West.  Geno Smith’s ascent was not an aberration.<br><br> 
          <strong>10. Jacksonville Jaguars</strong> - If you haven’t bought your Trevor Lawrence MVP ticket, you missed your chance.  At this point, everyone and their sister is in on it.  They’re adding Calvin Ridley to an already potent offence.  They’ll beat up on their AFC South underlings, but how do they stack up when matched against the big boys?<br><br> 
          <strong>9. New York Jets</strong> -  This isn't Hard Knocks.  No more curated production pieces they want to project upon the public.  It’s time to see what they got.  And on paper, it’s a panoply of talent.  Top of line quarterback, running backs and a stud receiver.  And their defence is unquestionably top three. Impressive pieces, but I don’t know how it all fits together.  When anything short of getting to the second-round of the playoffs would be considered a failure, they better hope they find their stride early.<br><br> 
          <strong>8. Miami Dolphins</strong> - The Dolphins entire football season, quite literally, rests on Tua Tagovailoa’s shoulders.  One more concussion and it could be sayonara.  The very stringent rules his repeated head injuries forced  the NFL to implement (concussion protocol guidelines) could cost him a series, a game, or more than one year game in the ultra-competitive AFC East.  There’s a cost to pay for having your quarterback’s head made of the finest porcelain china.<br><br> 
          <strong>7. Baltimore Ravens</strong> - LaMarr doesn’t throw outside the numbers.  Everything he throws is in the middle of the field; otherwise known as Andrew’s Country.  So they sign OBJ, draft the stud receiver Zach Flowers, and bring in a new offensive coordinator to push the ball down the field?  Call me crazy, but I have serious reservations about this new direction.<br><br> 
          <strong>6. Dallas Cowboys</strong> - Is Pollard an every-down back?  As much as I think he could run for 2000 yards, he’s never been asked to shoulder the lion’s share of carries.  They have a top three defence and Cooks was a good addition on offence.  With Mike McCarthy calling plays, what could possibly go wrong?<br><br>
          <strong>5. San Francisco 49ers</strong> - The Trey Lance miss was a bitter pill to swallow, but it was never going to work.   They return much of the team intact from last year. Purdy remains a bit of a question mark, but bringing back Bosa is the pressing concern.  They'll be in the mix at the end. They're too good to be otherwise.<br><br>
          <strong>4. Buffalo Bills</strong> - Has the Bills Super Bowl bubble burst? The skeptics are crowding in, pointing to the Allen/Diggs feud, the lack of a running game, and a defence on the decline. They are the third best team in the conference, and unless they find a way to play their best football in January instead of October, that’s not going to change.<br><br> 
          <strong>3. Cincinnati Bengals</strong> -  The Bengals will move the ball.  With Burrow, Chase and Higgins, it's a given.  The challenge will be replacing the pieces that got away on defence.  This is a team that is built to win.  It follows the lead of its best player, who has proven through both his collegiate and professional career that he can take his team where it needs to get.<br><br>
          <strong>2. Philadelphia Eagles</strong> - Mega-talent on both sides of the ball.  While I expect the defence to regress slightly, the offence will only get better.  AJ Brown and DeVonte Smith are the best pair of wideouts in the league, and Goebart is an elite blocking/catching tight end.  Behind the best offensive line in football, they’ve retooled the backfield and still have a quarterback just beginning to realize his potential.  They’ll be contenders for years to come.<br><br> 
          <strong>1. Kansas City Chiefs</strong> - They don’t have the offensive weapons we’re accustomed to seeing, but they still have Patrick Mahones, Andy Reid and Travis Kelce.  The biggest question is if defensive lineman Chris Jones continues his holdout.  He’s stated he’s prepared to wait until Week 8, willing to incur penalties of more than a million dollars in per week.  The trouble is he’s that good.  Like Aaron Donald, opposing offences have to game plan around one player. The Chiefs badly need him if they want to be the first repeat Super Bowl winner since 2005. 
          <br><br>
          Tricky Rick is the first to crack the century mark and has opened up a five point lead. Conor, Adam and John Harper were all one pick away from a free steak dinner. The free steak dinner has been on offer for a perfect score since the Pick'em competition commenced back in..... a long time ago. A lot of people have come close, but no one has got it yet. Still five alive in the Survivor Series. Check your score. And a reminder, all picks are final.
