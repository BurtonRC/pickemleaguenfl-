        <p>
          A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
          <br><br>
          A couple quick observations.
          <br><br>
          Kansas City is not winning the Super Bowl.
          <br><br>          
          Baltimore has led at the two-minute warning in all 15 games this year. Only two other teams have accomplished that: (1972 Dolphins - Super Bowl Champions) (2007 Patriots - Lost the Super Bowl)  
          LaMarr Jackson is the Most Valuable Player. I think we'd forgotten how good he is after missing large portions of the past two seasons. 
          San Francisco will be fine. The same can't be said of Philadelphia. They are a very vulnerable and would do well to get out of the wild-card round. 
          I really want to see the Rams against the Lions in the wild-card round. I think Staffford can go back to Motor City and win. The LA @ SF game in the final week could be huge. (June!)
          <br><br>          
          Joe Flacco should get Comeback Player of the Year. Does he play another year? He could, but it's not going to be in Cleveland. He plays the Jets on Thursday; a team he'd played for and was familiar with, yet didn't consider re-signing when Aaron Rodgers went down. That in itself should be enough to get Joe Douglas fired, but the Jets are already pledged to bring Douglas and Salah back for another year. This is how you award the braintrust of a franchise that hasn't made the playoffs for 13 seasons, 
          Tell me anyone who had the Bucs pegged to win the NFC South with Baker Mayfield at the controls? His play this year could earn him, at a minimum, a two-year, $60 million contract. These sums are ungodly. Imagine looking at your portfolio and seeing eight or nine digits.
          <br><br>           
          Carolina had their best offensive performance last week against the Packers. The Bus had theirs the previous week. Coincidence? The only reason the Packers won't be in the playoffs is their defence. 
          <br><br>          
          Tricky Rick continues his stellar play. He hasn't faltered since claiming the lead in Week 9. Matt is in the only position to reel him in with two weeks left. 
          <br><br>          
          Happy 2024. Peace and harmony can't be had, but hoping it's a healthy and prosperous year for us all.
          <br><br>
