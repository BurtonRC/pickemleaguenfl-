              A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
              <br><br>             
              I had such a poor week picking I wasn't going to write a report. I recall being clear-headed on Sunday morning when I made my selections, but there was obviously some underlying condition that would compel me to pick Carolina and Las Vegas and a number of other head-scratchers. I haven't looked at the leaderboard because I fear I've done irreparable damage to my chances of winning the league. There are 48 games left, with lots of points on offer. If I close hard, I might have a chance. 
              <br><br>
              A couple things.... Goff has won a game throwing five interceptions and lost a game throwing five touchdowns. What that says is the Lions defence can no longer bail out poor offensive performances. They have too many missing pieces on defence. And the injuries keep coming. They lost a couple more on the back-end and their first major casualty on the offence, David Montgomery. Gibbs is great, but it was the loss of the one-two Montgomery/Gibbs punch that will really hurt the offence. So if Ben Johnson is an offensive genius and Detroit has established itself as a run-first team, why does he call three passes in the first series of the game? Three incompletions later, they're punting the ball. It didn't make any sense to me. Perhaps one of you can explain it to me. And Campbell trying an on-side kick with 12 minutes to go when the success rate of recovering on-side kicks was less than seven per cent. This wasn't analytics or being true to the identity of the team. That was bad-coaching. I fear the Lions peaked in November and are too depleted to win in January. The Bills have scored 30 points or more in eight straight games. Kansas City hasn't scored 30 points in a game this year. As a sideline, there are only four teams in NFL history that have scored 30+ points for eight straight games. The 2000 Rams, the 2007 and 2010 Patriots, and the 2013 Broncos. None of them won a Super Bowl. Mind you, three of them lost in the Super Bowl. I would be shocked if Buffalo or Baltimore doesn't represent the AFC in the Super Bowl. Houston and Pittsburgh are not nearly as good as their records say they are. The Chargers are frauds. And the Broncos are a nice comeback story, but they can't compete with the Bills or the Ravens. 
              <br><br>              
              All indications would say Philadelphia is the best team in the NFC, with the Lions now in full retreat. For me, there are two red flags; Jalen Hurts and Nick Sirianni. I don't trust either of them. If there's a bad decision to be made in a playoff game to be had, they would be at the top of my list of would-be candidates. The Eagles are solid up and down the line-up, with great offensive and defensive lines, which allows them to control the line of scrimmage, an MVP-calibre back and a pair of great wideouts. All is cool, but the quarterback and the coach, which are two major cogs in any football operation. Everything was clicking on Sunday against Pittsburgh, which is more an 8-6 team than a 10-4 team, so they looked like a million dollars. The Eagles are a good team and when they play well, they'll win a lot more than they lose. But they are going to be days when things aren't going their way, when the ball is not bouncing in their favour. Those times, more than any other, you look for a calm head on the sidelines and a level head calling the play in the huddle. I don't think either of them fits that mold. In the quarterback / coach quotient, they don't have a good score. There are few Super Bowl winners without the quarterback-coach combination. Trace it back. Mahomes-Reid, Stafford-McVay, Belichick-Brady. The most recent outlier would be Pederson-Foles, still an awful pill to swallow all these years later.  
              <br><br>              
              And a couple other things....The Falcons had 24 first-down snaps. They ran the ball on 23 of them. You can't hide your flawed quarterback. Playing against nearly anyone other than the Raiders and it would have been a loss. Cousins has two years left on a three-year $180 million contract, with lots of dead money for opting out early. Just Eberflus needed someone to teach him how to be a head coach, Caleb Williams is in need of someone to teach him how to be a good NFL quarterback. He looks lost. He was terrible on Monday night. Chicago is a badly-flawed football franchise. Weak ownership. A detached president. They better get their coach right next year or fear losing their franchise quarterback. The Krafts are already contemplating getting rid of their hand-picked successor to the greatest coach in history. If BB had a half-way serviceable starting quarterback instead of Mac Jones in his final years, he'd still be in New England. Have you seen Mac Jones in Jacksonville filling in for Trevor Lawrence? Mind-boggling bad. Tommy DeVito, Tim Boyle, Will Levins, Mac Jones, Jake Haener, Desmond Ritter. Just a sampling of the poor quarterbacking on offer this past weekend.

              Another full slate again this week, and the best three are the first three of the week. <strong>Remember the two games on Saturday</strong>.
