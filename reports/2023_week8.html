        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Welcome to the Wednesday Report <span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 15px;">(tap and scroll text)</span></p><br>
        <p>
          <strong>6, 7, 4, 4, 5, 6, 9, 9, 5, 4, 5 , 6...</strong> those numbers look more like the pitch count of batters in a championship baseball game or hole scores of a really bad golfer on a good day, rather than the weekly scores of the top dozen in our pick'em competition. Whereas last week we had a 15 and more than half the scores were double digits, this week there were numerous 3s and 4s. Former pick'em champion, Matthew, needed a db by Minnesota in the final game of the week to eke out a 3. Just to put that into some context, he was one for twelve in the dozen games earlier in the week. 1 for 12! That's like a Captain Kirk record in prime-time.  Who would have guessed Cousins would show up on a Monday night? When the lights are bright, Cousins is usually out of sight, and I say that not in a good way. But he was brilliant on Monday. He carved up the Niners for close to 400 yards and stayed clean all night. The vaunted Niner pass-rush never touched him, and when they did get close he showed some quick feet in tight quarters, a quality he very rarely demonstrates. When he got picked on the first drive of the night, who of you had him having the night he did? With all that said, McConnell did his best to give the game away. His play-calling was ultra-conservative. I think they ran the ball on every first down. It was Cousins time and again who got them out of second and long and third-down situations. They kicked a field-goal on fourth and goal from the 2. They kicked a field-goal on fourth and goal from the 3. They missed a field-goal on fourth and four from the Niners 42, when they elected to run the ball on third down rather than let Cousins throw for the first-down.

          Nonetheless, it was a great win for the Vikings. They thoroughly outplayed the Niners, one the top three or four teams in the league. They're now 3-4 and just a half-game out of a playoff spot in the NFC. After starting 0-4 and talking rebuild,  they've won three in a row and proven to themselves they can play the big boys. I say this all before they go to Green Bay next Sunday and drop a brick. Count on it. Being a long-time Viking fan who was eventually anguished out, I'm telling you that's how it plays out even before it happens. The question now becomes, what do you do with Captain Kirk? He's 35 and contract runs out at the end of the year. If he walks, the Vikings have a big dead-cap hit (money they will have to pay because it was deferred earlier) and no quarterback. They can defray the cost if they sign him to an extension, but with Kirk putting up performances like he did last night, why would he want to sign an extension? Wait until the end of the season and let the bidding war begin for the self-proclaimed anti-vaxxer. The Vikings also have to negotiate a new contract with Justin Jefferson, which will be north of the four-year $120 million the Fins paid Tyrek Hill. Meanwhile, Commissioner John is crunching numbers to finance a modest refresh of his Wolseley house. Woest the life of a pleb.

          Speaking of Justins, are we sure Justin Herbert is a good quarterback? When was the last time you saw him play a good second-half, let alone engineer a four-quarter game-winning drive? The Chargers score 17 in the first half against the Chiefs and he's a complete no-show in the second half. This is more than a trend. It's a habit.  He had a chance to win their opener against Miami in the final minutes. Nothing. He had a chance to beat Tennessee in the final minute of their second game and didn't make it happen. He played so extraordinarily the next week against the Vikings it makes you forget he let the two previous games slip away. The public has anointed and appointed him a great quarterback status, without the wins to back it up. The Chargers are 2-4 and looking every bit the pretenders they show themselves to be every year. Less than halfway through the year, the Chiefs have already claimed the AFC West. Their nearest contender in the AFC is not the Dolphins, who were beaten up by the Eagles, or the Bills, who's decimated defence got sliced and diced by the mighty Mac Jones and the Patriots. The Chiefs biggest threat at this point looks to be the Ravens. They thoroughly embarrassed the up-start Lions. They were leading 28-0 before the Lions got a first-down. Lamarr is looking every bit worth the massive contract he signed with the Ravens this summer when no other teams, including many quarterback-needy team backed away, choosing to stay with Desmond Ridder and alike. Compare Lamarr with the other $250 million quarterback from the AFC Central, DeShaun Watson. I truly don't understand what's going on. You never know if he's going to play because even when he's given medical clearance to play, he chooses not to. When he does play, he gives his best impression of Nathan Peterman. Like anything conducted by the Browns, it turned into a PR nightmare, which they should have known it would be when they signed the disgraced quarterback from Houston in the first place.

          We're down to a handful in the Survivor Series with three more tapping out this weekend. Five left. We got Tricky Rick Halas, the lucky gambler, or so he claims. Noel Leon, the one and only actual palindrome you'll ever know. The Dublin Cowboy, Daryl Krywonis, transplanted Dubliner, who pines every year about this time for the cold of his hometown Winnipeg. Brett Steidl, one of the two Steidl in the competition, although I don't know if he and Gavin are brothers or father and son. And Kong Vong, who goes by Nico, which I'm sure has nothing to do with the Velvet Underground.

          A full slate of 16 games this week.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
