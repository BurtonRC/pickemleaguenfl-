                A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL. After last weekend, I have an even greater conviction that the more football I watch, the less I know, at least from a pick'em perspective.  Cincinnati, who I doubled down on last week despite their 1-2 start, got throttled 27-3 to Tennessee.  I didn't even think Tennessee was capable of scoring 27 points.  As for the Bengals, without their talisman, Joe Burrow, they are a rudderless ship.  Although the team hasn't said they would sit him and allow the lingering calf injury to heal, he's not doing the team any favours standing in the pocket looking more vulnerable than an aging Ben Roethlisberger.  The deep throw and the threat of the deep pass has been the Bengals offensive calling card since Burrow and Chase arrived.  With no leg to drive off, the top's been taken off the offence with defences no longer fearing the big play and crowding the line of scrimmage.   Although that's the biggest problem, it's far from the only one. The offensive line is broken beyond repair and the defence, that had always been the effective, yet underappreciated unit, has lost its mojo.  Can they be resurrected?  There's no easy solution.  They have no confidence in their back-up and the status quo is unassailable. After last week's performance, it's hard to have confidence in the Bengals moving forward this year. 
                <br><br>
                And then there's the Giants. This betting line on the game against Seattle started with the Giants giving 2.5. By game time, they were taking 2.5. Smart money looked at this team and saw what a lot of laymen already knew; this is a bad team. They have been outscored in the first half of this year's games by a whopping margin.  They're tied with the Bengals with the lowest average per play in the league. No Barkley doesn't help, but they have no one to stretch the field , nor an offensive line that would protect Daniel Jones long enough for him to throw down the field. He was rained down on, sacked 11 times and under constant pressure. Repeated penalties on Monday night rendered that game virtually unwatchable. It was a constant barrage of yellow. Trips to Miami and Buffalo will leave Giants 1-5, the season lost and tied to a quarterback who will never be able to take where they want to go. 
                <br><br>
                Finding and retaining a winning quarterback is as elusive to general managers as it’s always been. There are very, very few locks when it comes to picking a quarterback. Carolina had the first pick in last year’s draft. They’d paid a king’s ransom to Chicago to secure the first selection. The Panthers had their choice of three high-touted college quarterbacks all expected to go in the first five picks. Four games into the season, there’s no question they got it wrong. Whereas CJ Stroud, who went to Houston with the second pick and Anthony Richardson to Indianapolis with the fourth pick, have thrived, showing signs of maturity beyond their years, Bryce Young looks lost. Even with a dearth of talent on the offensive side of the ball, he looks small (5’10”), unsure and scared. 
                <br><br>
                When you miss with your quarterback, you have to be getting everything else right to win. There are few teams that bet big on quarterback, lose, and retain their position. San Francisco bet big on Trey Lance, whiffed, yet held their own by finding the unplucked gem, Brock Purdy in the 7th round. In the last several years there have been far more misses than hits at quarterback in the first round. Last year, Kenny Pickett of the Steelers, was the only quarterback picked in the first. Although the jury is still out, early returns this year have been anything but positive. Two years ago, five quarterbacks went in the first. Only Trevor Lawrence will succeed. Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Justin Fields and  Mack Jones won’t. Although three are still starting there’s no guarantee of their future beyond this season. Let me just briefly focus on Mack Jones. After last week’s debacle, he’s now 0-12 when the Patriots are underdogs. How can a team have faith in their quarterback's ability to rise to the occasion, when he repeatedly sabotages the team's ambitions? Strip sack touchdown and a pick-six killed the game before half-time. If anything Mack has regressed from last year when all the blame was laid solely at two defensive coaches who assumed control of the offence. High expectations came with Bill  O’Brien, but the play calling and offensive approach has failed badly. Every week they fall behind and this is not a team designed to come from behind. When you have third and half a yard from the Dallas five in your first possession, make it a four-down territory. Instead Mack flings it over the head of the wide open tight end and they settle for a field goal.  The Pats don’t merit even the few sentences I have given them, but another lost season and the unavoidable quandary of finding another quarterback depresses me to no end.

                I completely ran out of time. Slew of crises arrived Wednesday.
