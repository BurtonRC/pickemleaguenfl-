          A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
          <br><br>
          Again, I didn't give myself enough time. We have a good game to start the week and a good game to end the week. The great game on Sunday will be the Grey Cup with Winnipeg against Montreal. Winnipeg is a 7.5 point favourite and you can take that one to the bank. This coming from a guy 19 points behind the leader in the Pick'em. 
          <br><br>
          Tricky Rick is a machine, consistently churning out solid numbers week after week. He's opened up a seven point lead over Brett, who has correctly guessed every PS Game of the Week. If he's not a gambler, he should be. Compare that to Daryl, who's got one single measly PS point this entire year. Nonetheless, those are the last two standing in the Survivor Series. It'll be a cage match from here, with only one man standing at the end.
