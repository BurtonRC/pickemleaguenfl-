        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Welcome to the Wednesday Report <span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 15px;">(tap and scroll text)</span></p>
        <p>
          A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
          <br><br>
          I don't think any team in the AFC wants to play the Buffalo Bills in the playoffs.  Maybe this is the route they had to go to win a Super Bowl?  They've come close.   If you're old like me, you remember the Jim Kelly teams that knocked on the door four straight years but never got in that exclusive club of NFL champions. But when a tortured fan base finally breaks through, it has to be weird.  It's never going to be easy: it has to come from the other direction. 
          <br><br>
          There are a ton of examples, but the 2017 Philadelphia Eagles fits perfectly.  Believe it or not, Carson Wentz was a really good player early in his career.  Week 14 he goes down with a torn ACL and it appears yet another talented Eagles team was preparing to flame out in the playoffs, as they'd down for years with Andy Ried.  Nick Foles (Nick Foles!) comes off the bench to lead them to their first Super Bowl in franchise history.  Nick Foles and Doug Pederson against Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.  And they won.  I've never fully recovered.  It was weird, strange and highly improbable. 
          <br><br>          
          Enter the 20223 Buffalo Bills.  They start 6-6, losing games they never should have lost and are in a genuine peril of missing the playoffs.  We find out that their coach was using the 9/11 terrorists as an example of working together.  This actually happened and it wasn't an Onion headline, which I thought it was when I first heard it.  They lose their best linebacker.  They lose their best defensive back.  They fire their offensive coordinator and look where they are.  They're 8-6 after beating the defending Super Bowl Champions on their home turf and then thumping the Cowboys by three touchdowns, with Josh Allen completing just seven passes all game.  Mid-season, the Bills had one of the worst defences in the league.  On Sunday, Prescott and the vaunted Cowboy offence couldn't even get started.  The Bills will beat up the Chargers this weekend and the Patriots the next, before playing against the Dolphins, in a game that could be for the AFC East. Miami's final three games: Cowboys, @ Ravens, Bills. 
          <br><br>          
          As for the Cowboys?  What can you say?  Dallas is 7-0 at home and below .500 on the road.  The Cowboys average 40 points a game at home and have a +171 scoring margin.  On the road, they average 21 points and have a minus-4 scoring margin.  This is especially bad news for a team that probably is going to have to play at Philadelphia or at San Francisco to get to the Super Bowl.  It has played in both of those stadiums this year and lost by a combined score of 70-33.  Mind you, I'd like their chances against Philly after what has become of them. 
          <br><br>         
          With the exception of the Jets against the Commandos and the Bears and the Cardinals, every game this weekend has playoff implications.  It was my plan to talk about a number of them, but it's Christmas.  There are drinks to be drunk and butter tarts to prepare, gifts to be bought and promises to be kept.
          <br><br>         
          Wishing all of you the very best this holiday season, even those of you who have chosen to opt out early. We're not all going to win, but come on, you play until you hear the whistle.
          <br><br>
