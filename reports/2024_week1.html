        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Welcome to the Wednesday Report <span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 15px;">(scroll text)</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>
                A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL. Football is back, baby! For the next five and half months, it's non-stop NFL and gridiron's on-going quest for world domination. They make their first foray into Brazil this week, and games happening four days a week is becoming the rule, more than the exception. Let the speculation and conjecture abound as we kick off the new season with our annual NFL Pick'em team rankings. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>32. Carolina Panthers</strong> - Unless new head coach Dave Canales is a miracle worker, I'm not sure Bryce Young can be a functional quarterback, let alone merit the huge aspirations of being a first overall pick. This is a troubled franchise that has been cratering since its meddlesome owner Dave Tepper bought the team in 2018.<br>
                <strong>31. New England Patriots</strong> - If they're not the worst team, they're damn close. What has become of my beloved Patriots? Their offence is a year away from being a year away. The offensive line is so bad they're sitting their rookie quarterback for his own protection. Their three best defensive assets are absent; Matthew Judon was traded, Christian Barnmore has blood clots and hasn't played this year and the GOAT of coaches is appearing on Manningcasts and podcasts galore. Who knew Bill Belichick had a personality?<br>
                <strong>30. Washington Commanders</strong> - The best thing that can be said about the worst named team in professional sports is they have a new ownership group. As well as a new coach, a new offensive coordinator, and a rookie quarterback. They also unveiled new jerseys. Sadly, none of that will change what has become an old habit; losing football games.<br> 
                <strong>29. Tennessee Titans</strong> - After firing Mike Vrabel and failing to re-sign Derrick Henry, I have a hard time thinking the Titans of 2024-25 will be better than the far from contending Titans of 2023-24, If I had more faith in Will Levins in getting the ball to Calvin Ridley and past-his-prime-but still-potentially-still-dangerous DeAndre Hopkins, I might think differently.<br> 
                <strong>28. Las Vegas Raiders</strong> - You can't sugarcoat this. The Las Vegas Raiders are a bad football team. Don't let last year's 8-9 record fool you. The happy-go-lucky Gardner Minshew story has worn thin. When a career back-up becomes your starter in his seventh year, you know you're in a bad place.<br> 
                <strong>27. NY Giants</strong> - The expectations for rookie wide receiver Makik Nabers is neighbouring on ridiculous. Don't forget who's throwing him the ball? Daniel Jones behind a porous offensive line with no Saquon Barkley spells trouble, regardless of who's on the outside.<br>
                <strong>26. Arizona Cardinals</strong> - Would Marvin Harrison Jr. get this kind of hype if his name was Austin or Bob? When you borrow the name of your Hall of Fame father, you court comparisons. Marvin Sr, had Peyton Manning throwing him the ball. I don't put Tyler Murray in the same bracket.<br> 
                <strong>25. New Orleans Saints</strong> - The Saints are playing on borrowed time. It's an old roster with no room under the salary cap. They've been paying too many blue-chip salaries for red-chip players.  You can do that for a couple years if you're competing for a SuperBowl. The Saints are only seeking mediocrity.<br> 
                <strong>24. Denver Broncos</strong> - I'm a little higher on the Broncos than most. Rookie or not, Bo Nix will run a Sean Payton offence more effectively than Russell Wilson. All the same, it won't be pretty.<br> 
                <strong>23. Minnesota Vikings</strong> - The defence will continue to be aggressive and opportunistic. It's the Sam Darnold offence that scares me now that their quarterback succession plan to Captain Kirk is on the sidelines for the year.<br> 
                <strong>22. Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong> - What is the common thread amongst all the teams in back-third of this year's ranking? A suspect quarterback. You simply can't win in the modern NFL with an average quarterback. And I would list Baker Mayfield as an average quarterback, despite perhaps his best season being his last. I don't see a playoff team or a winning record. I see some bottom-hooping in the worst division in football.<br> 
                <strong>21. Pittsburgh Steelers</strong> - See quarterbacking comments above. The defence should be even stronger after landing play-making linebacker Patrick Queen from Baltimore, but it won't make up for a highly suspect offence.<br> 
                <strong>20. LA Chargers</strong> - Jim Harbaugh is in at coach and Justin Herbert is still a quality quarterback, but offensive weapons Austin Eckler, Keenan Allen and Mike Williams are all gone. Like the Clippers in basketball, the Chargers can't find a home in Los Angeles, where they play a distant second-fiddle to the other LA team as evidenced by opposition team fans outnumbering the powder-blue faithful in SoFi stadium.<br>  
            
                <br>    
                Any team from here on in can make the playoffs. I don't see any teams 20 and up making it to the postseason.
                <br><br>
           
                <strong>19. Seattle Seahawks</strong> - It will be a new Seahawks era with Pete Carroll gone and the highly-sought after former Baltimore defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald taking the reins.  The former run-heavy schemes favoured by Carroll teams are expected to be replaced with a bigger passing game, putting a greater emphasis on Geno Smith to be at his best.<br> 
                <strong>18. Indianapolis Colts</strong> - After getting a taste of what Anthony Richardson can do in the first three games last year, the playbook will be opened up, giving the second-year quarterback the opportunity to showcase his unique skill-set. With expectations sky-high, the Colts are a team on the rise.<br>
                <strong>17. Jacksonville Jaguars</strong> -  Although Trevor Lawrence is capable of being a top ten quarterback, there's inconsistency. He averaged almost a pick a game last year and surrendered far too many sacks.  That, coupled with the team's end-of-season melt-down last year, makes me wary of placing them any higher.  They also have the undisputed ugliest uniforms in football.<br> 
                <strong>16. Cleveland Browns</strong> - The defence is top-five. The offence is another question. With DeShaun Watson, you can't be sure what you're going to get. Nick Chubb, lost in a gruesome injury in Week 2 last year, is on injured reserve and won't be back until at least Week 5. Whether he can return to the dominant running back he once was remains a big question.<br> 
                <strong>15. LA Rams</strong> - How do you replace Aaron Donald? You don't. The defence is bound to take a step back, whereas the offence should be able to carry the load with a healthy Cooper Cupp, second-year stars Puka Nacau and Kyren Williams, and a more than capable, Matthew Stafford. The NFC West could be a highly-competitive division.<br> 
                <strong>14. Chicago Bears</strong> - I can't believe I have the Bears ranked 14th. They've been also-rans for so long it looks like a misprint. But after getting a boatload of players and draft picks from Carolina for last year's first overall draft pick, and selecting Caleb Williams with this year's first overall, the team seems set to challenge for the first time in a long time.<br>
                <strong>13. Atlanta Falcons</strong> - I don't know how good the Falcons are. They'll win the NFC South by beating a trio of bad teams in Carolina, New Orleans and Tampa Bay. They've brought in a lot of new faces, including Captain Kirk, who should provide a serious upgrade at quarterback.<br>
                <strong>12 Miami Dolphins</strong> - In the Miami Dolphins, I see a team with a lot of flash and not enough grit. They have speed to burn on offence, and a coach that can draw-up play-action schemes defences seldom see, All the same, I always fear Tua is one big hit from a brain injury. They're missing a couple key pieces on defence (Christian Wilkins and Bradley Chubb on PUP) and the toughness a Vic Fangio defence-coached team always has.<br>
                <strong>11. Green Bay Packers</strong> - They're young, one of the youngest rosters in football. And after the smackdown they gave Dallas in Dallas last January, and the scare they gave San Francisco, anything but a deep run in the postseason would be a disappointment. Jordan Love was great in the last half of the season. Can he be great for an entire season?<br>
                <strong>10. Dallas Cowboys</strong> - The Cowboys make as many off-the-field headlines as they do on-the-field. If it's not Ceedee Lamb's new contract, it's Dak's lack of a new contract. And Jerry Jones will tell you everything you don't need to know about the Cowboys whether he's asked or not. Long-time defensive coordinator and former head coach of the Vikings, Mike Zimmer comes out of retirement to take over the defence. I like the move.<br>  
                <strong>9. NY Jets</strong> - They could be frauds, but until we see what Aaron Rodgers can do at 41, all bets are off. Garrett Wilson is a stud outside and Breece Hall was the top pick on many fantasy football boards. If all the offensive line additions can mesh into a workable unit, perhaps they can work some 1969 magic. I seriously doubt it.<br>
                <strong>8. Buffalo Bills</strong> - This is the Josh Allen show and he, and he alone, will dictate the fortunes of the Bills. Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis are gone on offence, and their best defensive player, Matt Milano, is expected to miss the majority of 2024 with a torn bicep. If the Bills Super Bowl window hasn't closed completely, it's perilously close.<br> 
                <strong>7. Cincinnati Bengals</strong> - Like the Bills, the Bengals aspirations are tied to their quarterback. Joe Burrow missed the majority of last year and the health of his throwing arm remains a question mark heading into the new year. Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins are still there, but Tyler Boyd and Joe Mixon have found riches elsewhere. This is not a team that will win defensive struggles. Their offence will have to win them games.<br> 
                <strong>6. Houston Texans</strong> - More than willing to admit my errors, I had the Texans ranked 1th heading into last season. With a rooke coach and quarterback, I didn't see a lot of upside. The turnaround has been rapid, and they bring more pieces to the party this year. They acquired offensive assets from two of their AFC rivals without losing any marquee players over the off-season. They're solid on both sides of the ball.<br> 
                <strong>5. Philadelphia Eagles</strong> - I'm not buying the uncertainty in Philadelphia. Head coach Nick Sirianni's tenure has been up in the air since last season's collapse and before the coach/quarterback offensive squabbles became a controversy. Their All-Pro center Jason Kelce has retired and there's been a large turnover of personnel. But I have a lot of belief in GM Howie Roseman and his ability to construct an NFL roster to compete with the best.<br>   
                <strong>4. Detroit Lions</strong> - The guffaws came from all corners when Dan Campbell took over the team in 2021. Who's laughing now? They've brought back all their offensive starters and added some talent to the defensive side, which was their achilles last year. The large majority of their games are indoors, which plays to their strengths. It's a good time to be a Lions fan, if there's any amongst us.<br> 
                <strong>3. San Francisco 49ers</strong> - While the Brandon Aiyuk contract has finally been resolved, the Trent Williams impasse lingers. Despite being 36, he's the best offensive lineman in football and wants his salary to reflect that. Like Dallas, this is a top-heavy team with a small portion of players eating up a big chunk of their salary cap. If the Williams holdout is settled, which I expect it to be, the 49ers will once again be playing deep into January.<br> 
                <strong>2. Baltimore Ravens</strong> - Like everyone else, I'm anxious to see Derrick Henry in the same backfield as Lamarr Jackson. The Ravens have won more than 75 percent of their games since Lamarr became their starter.  Barring an injury, they will no doubt return to the playoffs, where they have fallen short for several years running.<br>
                <strong>1. Kansas City Chiefs</strong> - The Chiefs have won the last two Super Bowls and three of the last five. Despite some defections on defence, they've added some speed at wide receiver to help stretch the field. Players come and go, but the pillars of the team (Patrick Mahones, Andy Reid, Chris Jones) remain intact with it a legitimate chance to achieve what until now has been unachievable, the threepeat.
                <br><br>
                That's kinda, sorta how I see it. What you say? Whatever you throw at me, I've been called worse.
                <br><br>
                Everyone knows the rules. There are only two new faces and they've been briefed. Don't forget your Survivor pick. Place it underneath all your game selections. Eric "the Disruptor" Matthies has been calling for a host of changes to scoring, format, you name it. To quiet his cavils, he's taken over selecting the Point Spread (PS) Game of the Week. This may only be a temporary appeasement. Remember, you have to pick the PS game twice; one for the outright winner and one with the point spread factored in.

                One of our Irish contingent in the competition, Rowdy Roudy, is by trade a graphic designer / illustrator. He is in the process of developing a website to help streamline NFL Pick'em operations. In the future, everything will flow through it; Wednesday Reports, team selections, standings, Survivor results, method of payment. As I say, it is in development, but I will keep everyone apprised of its launch date. Hosting costs, which I expect to be nominal, will be underwritten by entry fees. I will provide further details in the coming weeks.
                <br><br>
                There are 34 of us. The entry fee is $95. I haven't worked out first, second, third prize money as I'm running late. The Survivor winner receives $340.

                I think that's everything for now. Good luck all.
