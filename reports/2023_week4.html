        <br>

                A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL. The more I watch this game the less I seem to know. Miami hanging a seventy-burger on Sean Payton team? Miami had the ball eleven times and scored a touchdown ten times. The only reason they didn't score an eleventh time was the mercy rule. 730 yard of offence? That's averaging more than 10 yards a play for the 71 they ran on the day. Offences are always utilizing new schemes and personnel. Pre-snap motion has become a staple of modern offences and are often used to disguise play selection or figure out whether the opposing defence is playing man or zone. But no one has even used motion the way Miami has or has the speed merchants to exploit defences so easily. At the same time, giving up 70! That's unheard of, especially for a coach of the pedigree of Sean Payton. Say what you like, Payton consistently, for more than a decade, kept the Saints a viable, playoff-calibre team. Hell, he helped them win a Super Bowl. He hasn't forgotten how to coach, but he's obviously never come across of an offence like the Dolphins. The surprising thing is that Denver's defence was supposed to help keep the team competitive. Last year, they were eighth is the league in yards allowed.  This year, dead last. When Russ Wilson is the ninth of ten cratering problems on your team, you're in trouble. To steal a line from one of the Bourne movies, "You're in a deep pile of shit and you haven't got the shoes for it". The fact the Broncos are owned by the Walton family, the money-grabbing, child-exploiting, rapacious predators they are, makes it almost enjoyable. But at the same time, do you think the Waltons really care if the Broncos are a winning team? I mean, are they genuinely invested in whether they contend or not? People in Denver and Bronco fans around the globe care, but do the Waltons, cut-throat bandits they are, see the purchase of the Broncos as anything but another consistent money-making revenue stream? They're making boatloads of money from the franchise win, lose or draw. I suppose the same could be said for any of the 31 billionaires that own NFL franchises, Green Bay notwithstanding. It may be quixotic of me, but I think Eagles owner, Jeffrey Lurie, who was an Eagles season ticket-holder since a child, or Robert Kraft, who was a life-long Patriots fan and season-ticket-holder, prior to owning the team, have a a stronger, more fervent attachment for their team's on-field performance. Who knows? Maybe it's just me. As Rupert Murdoch says it doesn't matter if it's red or blue (win or lose). it's all about the green.

                We'll find out who's the worst of worst when the Bears tangle with the Broncos on Sunday. To give you any idea of how bad the Bears are, the Broncos, fresh off a beat-down where they give up the kind of points you associate with setting your thermostat, are giving three in Chicago. The Bears have lost 13 in a row and have been outscored by 190 in that period. This a is a level of dysfunction that is hard to achieve in the parity-driven NFL. But there is a scenario where their incompetence could be rewarded. If they continue to suck, where we're talking 3-14 kind of year-end numbers (I don't know where they find three wins), they put themselves in the driver's seat for the Caleb Williams sweepstakes.  There are four 0-3 teams.  The Bears own the first round-pick of two of those four teams; themselves and the 0-3 Panthers. And if you've wasted any time watching the Panthers, you know they have a legitimate claim on being amongst the worst. This looks like a race to the bottom with three teams vying for the services of what many are calling a Peyton Manning type of certainty at quarterback. 
                <br><br>
                Although we have a pretty clear idea of who are the creme de la creme, NFL teams have played only three of their seventeen game seasons. We're not even at the quarter pole.   It's often said teams need at least four games to figure out who they are. Meaning fully recognizing what things do they do well and devising a formula based on those attributes to help them win football games. For a lot of teams, it's far too early to be making any wholesale judgements, but on the Wednesday Report, that's what we do. So what do I make of a bunch of 1-2 teams, including Jacksonville, Cincinnati, and the Chargers, all playoff teams from last year? The Chargers are a lost cause. Justin Herbert will put up gaudy numbers, but the Chargers view defence is more of a concept than one of the principal pillars of the game.  Any team that badly-coached cannot be taken seriously. To say Jacksonville has been underwhelming would be an overstatement. From a personnel standpoint, they're better now than they were last year. It's just not translating into wins. Can I honestly see either of them challenging the Chiefs and the Dolphins and the Bills for AFC superiority? No. Of the three, I have for more faith in the Bengals, despite looking competent in one of three starts. The Bengals were 4-4 last year before they got hot and rode it deep into the playoffs.

                Usher is doing the Super Bowl halftime? I'm hardly a pop-culture maven, but wasn't he relevant 15 years ago? If it's the biggest stage on earth, shouldn't the halftime show have the biggest star? You don't have to look far to find her. There she is decked out in red and gold in a luxury suite at Arrowhead. Yes, Taylor Swift. She's the most recognizable name is the English language. More so than Trump, Biden or Brady. I should have something more to say about the Travis Kelce - Taylor Swift thing, but I really don't care. For the NFL, it's another marketing bonanza, the pr that keeps on giving. It generates headlines simply by existing. Kind of like a Kardashian. I wish them much happiness in their affair/relationship/coupling, but this is hardly the discovery of a new vaccine. It should be treated as such.

                I just want to make sure we understand how points are awarded in the Point Spread (PS) game of the week. You are essentially betting the game twice; once straight up and once with the point spread. They are distinct and separate bets. You get a point for each. If, like last week, one of the teams in the PS Game of the Week is a db, you can bet them to cover the spread, but you under no obligation to pick them to win the game. When dbs are featured in the PSGOTW, people often like to hedge their bets by taking the favourite to win and the db to cover, with the hope they win. You've heard of the expression, "Don't put your eggs all in one basket". A lot of times that's exactly what this is. Did I think Washington would win? No. Did I think they could cover and possibly win the game for me as a db, while at the same time fulfilling my db obligation of the week? That was a risk I was willing to take. Anyway, I hope that explains it a little better. Probably not. For some, it's probably muddier now than before you read this paragraph.

                Nine more bowed out of the Survivor series. Three weeks in and two-thirds of the entrants are out. What a sad lot. Not one of us saw Indy winning and only two of us had a db for the week, with Darren and Ross, backing the Texans. Our former champion, Matthew, had a six. All the worse when he calls out his beloved Cards to win in the preamble to his picks, only to back the Cowboys when his chips are down.  There are a number of us who withheld selections for the one of the Monday night games until that because Burrow's health status was questionable. That is not a violation. Submitting your pick before kick-off is an absolute.
