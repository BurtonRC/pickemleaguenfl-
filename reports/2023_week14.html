        <p>
          A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
          <br><br>
          We're into the final five weeks  of the season, and according to my calculations ,half (seven) of the playoff positions are still up for grabs.  In the AFC, Kansas City, Miami, and Baltimore are certainties, while in the NFC, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Dallas and Detroit have all but stamped their ticket.  Let's start in Philadelphia. 
          <br><br>
          The big story, aside from San Francisco steamrolling the Eagles, was Big Dom.  If you didn't see the game you're probably asking, "Who's Big Dom?"  Dom DiSandro is head of security for the Eagles, and is most definitely big, conservatively tipping the scales at three and a half, although it could be considerably more.  Big Dom might be the Eagles head of security, but at the speed he exhibited as he ambled off the field, he's not in the business of chasing too many people down.  He got into a scuffle with 49ers linebacker, Jeff Greenlaw that got them both tossed In another case of officiating stupidity.   I don't know what Big Dom was doing that close to the sideline and he most definitely instigated the melee, but he must be some kind of legend or personality because even the announcers knew him as Big Dom.   Anyway, take out a side-to-sideline linebacker for a team rep?  In no way is that fair.  Is this going to be a new cheap tactic?  In big games. make sure all your non-coach personnel on the sideline chirping all day, stirring up shit in the hopes you can lure a quality player from the opposing team into a scuffle?   I'm not saying the Eagles had Big Dom on the sideline with that in mind, but it sets an ugly precedent, and serves as a further example that referees should be full-time paid employees of the league, not store managers or bankers or househusbands, who ref on a part-time basis in a league worth billions, and where the weekly gambling market is the equivalent to the GDP of some war-torn, crime-riddled, malnourished African nation.  Big Dom got a standing ovation from the Eagles faithful as we waddled off the field and further burnished his legendary status with the team.  It got me thinking, what are the jobs of someone called Big Dom if he isn't head of security for a professional football team? Bouncer? Number two man in a pizza place? Wrestler? Porn star?   As far as the game goes, the Niners went up and down the field six straight times for touchdowns, established themselves as the best team in the league, and Brock Purdy avenged his demons, winning a big game in a  hostile environment, Big Dom and all.  The Niners have outscored the three teams on their schedule that could be considered Super Bowl potential teams 118-29, although Jacksonville would be considered dubious at best. When the Niners team is healthy, it's a beast.  In my mind, they're the team to beat, but injuries will play a huge part down the stretch.  We saw what they were without Deebo Samuel and Trent Williams.  Good seasons, even potentially great seasons, can be derailed by an inopportune injury.  Tank Dell and Trevor Lawrence's injuries are the first, of what could be several, that alter the fortunes of teams looking to make the postseason.
          <br><br>
          Has Gardiner Minshew single-handedly saved, or more perhaps more aptly, demonstrated the importance of the back-up quarterback position?  Remember, we were already writing off the Colts when they started 0-2, lost their highly-touted rookie quarterback, Anthony Richardson, for the year, hadn't brought their star running back, Jonathon Taylor, because of a contract dispute, and laughed at their ludicrous owner, Jim Irsay.   Well, Minshew is 7-3 since coming off the bench, and has the Colts right in the middle of the wonky AFC playoff race, where even a 2-3 finish could get them in.  At one time, having a competent back-up put your team in an envious position.  I'm aging myself. but Don Strock, who played his entire career in Miami in the mid 70's through the mid 80's, was always reliable and could have started for a number of teams.  Frank Reich was like that.  Seldom took the field backing up Jim Kelly, but orchestrated one of the great playoff comebacks of all-time in bringing the Bills back from a 35-3  deficit to the Houston Oilers.  Fitzpatrick was always a back-up and a fairly reliable one at that before leveraging that into a string of one or two year deals as starting quarterback in the back-half of his career.   Hostetler, Foles, Matt Cassel, even Cooper Rush.  I know I'm missing a few, but in a league where 40 percent of the quarterbacks stink or have starters sitting on the shelf because of injuries, having Mustache Minshew has proven to be a great insurance plan. He is one the quiet success stories of the year. 
          <br><br>
          So a couple weeks back I introduced the dirty dozen; bad quarterbacks called into action because the starter and/or the back-up was out of the game.  Nephew Matt forwarded to everyone some of the white knuckle quarterbacking duels we have on hand this week, starting on Thursday:
          <br><br>
          <strong>Bailey Zappe</strong> (New England) at <strong>Mitch Trubinsky</strong> (Pittsburgh)<br>
          <strong>CJ Beathard</strong> (Jacksonville) at <strong>Joe Flacco</strong> (Cleveland)<br>
          <strong>Baker Mayfield</strong> (Tampa Bay) at <strong>Drew Ridder</strong> (Atlanta)<br>
          <strong>Josh Dobbs</strong> (Minnesota) at <strong>Adrian O'Connell</strong> (Las Vegas)<br>
          <strong>Bryce Young</strong> (Carolina) at <strong>Jameis Winston</strong> (New Orleans)<br>
          <strong>Gardner Minshew</strong> (Indianapolis) at <strong>Jake Browning</strong> (Cincinnati)
          <br><br>
          Of all those games with the least amount of quarterbacking talent on display, I'd have to go Bailey Zappe at Mitch Trubinsky.  I've seen Mitch play enough to know there is nothing there. He doesn't pass the eye test; he didn't in Chicago and time hasn't improved his play in Pittsburgh.  Zappe delivers the same level of incompetence as Mac Jones, without the pick-sixes.  Oh, he'll get picked.  He just hasn't had any go the other way for points so far.  Give him time.  I could easily see that happening tomorrow night.  Just how bad is the Patriots offence?  Teams that give up 10 points or less are 51-3 this year. The three losses are all New England's and have all happened the last three weeks. The Chargers were favoured by 5.5 last week against the Pats. They scored 6 and still covered.  Top that.  
          <br><br>
          I have to resign myself to the fact that Bill Belichick won't be back with the Pats next year.  It'll be hard to see him in different colours next year, because don't fool yourself, he's coming back.  The inside track is Washington, with Riverboat Ron up the river and the new owners probably wanting to make a splash.  There are up to six or seven spots that could come open.  Las Vegas and Carolina are already looking.  Atlanta?  If Arthur Smith can't get the Falcons in the playoffs, I'd say he's gone.  New Orleans?  Dennis Allen hasn't done much, in fact, very little, but he's been with the team so long, I'm not sure if they'd pull the plug.  But it's an old team in need of a complete redo on defence and three quarterbacks, none of which are any good.  Chargers?  Brandon Staley will be fired, and it's an enviable position, but Spanos is tighter than a duck's butt, and will settle for the cheapest option.  Chicago? No slight to Uberflus, because you can only do so much when you consistently get sub-par play from your quarterback, but I don't think he's going to be around to work with Caleb Williams.  Tampa Bay?  Someone should relieve Todd Bowles of his responsibilities, if for no other reason than to take him out of his torment.  That is the most unhappy looking man I have ever seen.  There's stolid and stoic. He's more saturnine than anything.  NY Giants?  You're Coach of the Year one year and fired the next.  Despite his sour nature, I can't see the Giants dumping after two seasons.  NY Jets?  Did you know Salah has seven kids?  And all with one woman?  In the NFL, that has to be some sort of record.  Oh no, I forgot Phillip Rivers.  Eight kids, one mother.  But getting back to Salah, how does that work?  You're sleeping at the office or at the facilities 18 hours a day, seven days a week for six months of the year.  Meanwhile, your wife is trying to mother seven kids.  I definitely think Robert got the best of that deal.  As to his job security?  The defence loves him enough to compensate for all the missteps he took with Zach Wilson and should earn him at least another year.

          Tricky Rick not looking so tricky these days. Back-to-back nines has his lead down to five.
