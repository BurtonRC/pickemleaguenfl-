        <p>
          A biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
          <br><br>
          Did you know that not a soul took Chicago to win on Monday?  All 34 of us were in on the Vikes.  Have we lost our collective minds?  First of all, we're talking about the Minnesota Vikings; a NFL team that more so than any other takes stubborn pride in losing games they should win.  The fact they were favourites at home and that a win gives them the inside track on a playoff berth should have been enough to scare off more than a few of us.  Even the fact the quarterback is shacking up with a team-mate because history has told him not to get too comfortable (six teams in seven years) couldn't deter us.  This is a team that asks their fans to stretch their loyalty to uncomfortable lengths to accommodate their penchant for failing in spectacular manner.  Knowing these things, it shouldn't come as any surprise that they lost to the Bears, who came into the game riding a 12-game losing streak within the division.  That in itself should have had the staunchest purple and gold knowing a loss was at hand.  It may have taken more than 59 minutes, but in the end the Vikings do what they do best; further cement their ignominious legacy.
          <br><br>
          My take from the game, aside from the fact Josh Dobbs is indeed a journeyman quarterback despite what the past couple weeks may have suggested, is that there is nothing Justin Fields can do to stop the Bears from drafting a quarterback.  Joe Buck and Troy Aikman were talking about the final six games as being an audition or an evaluation period for Justin Fields to stake his claim to remaining the Bears starter.  In my mind, that ship has sailed.  He had a two and a half year audition and the reviews weren't great.  Although he displays flashes, he just as often fumbles like he did at crucial times in the fourth quarter, bringing his fumble total from the beginning of last year to 23, tops in the league.  Chicago owns Carolina's first pick and barring completely unforeseen circumstances, that will be the first pick in the draft. There are only so many times you get to draft in the top three with a pair highly-touted quarterbacks waiting in the wings.  Brock Purdy (pick 262) happens once every couple decades.  There is no greater competitive advantage that a NFL team can have than a good starting quarterback on a rookie contact.  Fields is in his rookie contract, but he's entering year four next year.  If Williams or Maye are as good as advertised, the Bears get a younger quarterback at a lower price and a full five year window to build to winning team, something the Bears haven't had for a very long time.  There's a place for Fields, just not in Chicago. 
          <br><br>
          News Flash: Frank Reich fired in Carolina, like we couldn't see that coming, even if the end of the year seemed more likely.  He was fired after 11 games, the shortest coaching tenure in 45 years.  Urban Meyer had a longer time with the Jaguars than Reich did with the Panthers. When you get less time than the circus-act that was Meyers, there's some fuckery afoot and his name is Dave Tepper.  He bought the team in 2018, fired Rowboat Ron the next year, hired Matt Ruhle out of college with no NFL experience to a 7 year, 63 million deal, fired him two years later with more than 40 million left owing, brought in Reich and decided to sack him after going 1-10, which in most cases in a fireable offence.  But more than Reich doing a good or bad job, is Tepper doing a disastrous job as owner.  On his third interim coach, Carolina has had six coaches since Tepper bought the team in 2018.  This is not a sign of organizational health.  Because Tepper owns the team, he thinks he knows football.  It doesn't work that way.  Being a hedge fund manager does not groom you to evaluate football talent.  It was Tepper who wanted Young, not Reich.  And when Reich couldn't make him a good NFL quarterback, Tepper fired Reich.  I don't know if there's a coach out there who can make Bryce Young a good NFL quarterback.  He's small.  He has limited arm strength, limited mobility. Those are the credentials of an armchair quarterback, not the skills needed to play the professional position well.  Granted, he's got a bad offensive line and a set of offensive weapons that would make even Chiefs or the Patriots cringe, but the evidence Bryce has provided can't have Panther fans glowing with optimism.  Where it goes from here, God only knows. Unless you're looking to be sacked and then live extravagantly with the millions Tepper is willing to give you to not coach the team, how can the Panthers hope to recruit a coach to work with a quarterback who has limited upside?  As Bill Parcells would say, "If you're going to make me chef, at least let me choose the ingredients".

          I'd already given up on him, but Jordan Love looked good on Thanksgiving.  They're 5-6 and play KC this week, so let's say 5-7, but their closing schedule is one of the easiest in the league.  If they went 4-1 coming home, which would be doable, they could slip in at 9-8.  After a good look at Dobbs on Monday, who the Packers play in one of their final five, we should put that hype train on hold.   Another team I'd already tossed to the scrap heap was the Rams.  They lit up the Cardinals and are also 5-6.  You know why running backs have such low market value?  Kyren Williams.  No one has heard of him one week and he puts up 230 yards up the next.  Add Stafford and Cupp and Pacua and McVay cooking up schemes and suddenly you have an offence putting up 500 yards, albeit against an anemic defence.  They have Cleveland coming to town this weekend, but after that performance in Denver, how much faith should I place in a 7-4 team?  I am still not buying Denver.  Not only do I have a hate-on for the ownership, but I have difficulty believing a team can lose by 50 and still be a playoff team.  I recognize teams change, develop familiarity, get better as the year goes on, but that's a bridge too far.  They're in Houston on Sunday.  The Texans, who I had listed as 31st team in NFL Ranking at the beginning of the year, is a legitimately good team.  Stroud looks like a star and I fully expect them to be in the playoffs at year end.  The more I read those last couple sentences, the more I recognize you should take nothing I say about football as credible and chalk it up to the biased, highly opinionated blather it is.  Listen to me and you'll be fighting to get into the top half of the league as well.  It bothers me more than a little that I feel I have more than a layman's knowledge of the game, yet my picking of games sucks.  Fargie, one of Daryl's dogs who sees pictures flashing from a screen and who wouldn't know football from spelunking, could put up numbers comparable to mine.  This, in no way, is meant to undermine those beneath me in the Pick'em Standings.  We all have tough years.

          A couple bookkeeping reminders.  Please include your selections from the early games with your submission on Sunday.  I really prefer not to go back through an email thread of 80+ submissions to find out who you took Thursday/Friday if you can easily include those selections with your later submission.  Just looking for ways to make this easier for me.  Although most of us understand the PS Game of the Week has two selections, some people continue to only give me one.  I recognize a number of the individuals failing to select the game twice aren't fighting for top spot, but a point is a point.  Brett had his PS streak snapped at 11 when the Eagles never kicked the extra point in overtime, while Daryl and Doug held firm at one PS out of 12.  Tricky Rick for the first time this year failed to record in double-digits and saw his lead slip to seven, the same number of people I still think are still in contention to win.  I can't imagine someone coming from nine back and leapfrogging six others along the way.  Sorry Chris.  By all means, prove me wrong.  Check your scores.  I going to have to round-up some of the outstanding dues. It would all be fine and good if I was going to win, but that's not happening. I don't want the winner sending their friend Rocco over to collect.
